# Success Is In...

A poetic reflection on the true nature of success and what it means to live a meaningful life.

<!--truncate-->

*Success is in remaining unattachedâ€”from money, sex and a high bed.*
*Success is in building a mansion, with the will to walk away and
inhabit a shed.*

*Success is in so outwitting the beast, that to fight is unnecessary.*
*Success is in so disciplining the Self, that no addiction is
adversary.*

*Success is in greeting the day with love, and ending the night with
praise.*
*Success is in charging forward again in spite of the sting of the
blade.*

*Success is in amassing the wealth of ability, not hoarding the fruits
thereof.*
*Ultimately, success is in knowing intimately the Universe and the
entrails thereof.*
