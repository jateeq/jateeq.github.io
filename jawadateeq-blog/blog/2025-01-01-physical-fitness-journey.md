# Diary of a Physical Transformation Journey

A chronicle of my ongoing journey toward physical fitness and self-improvement through calisthenics.

Dear Diary,

I have gained 3 KGs. Wow.

Not sure what to make of it. My gut reaction was to spiral into a
vicious cycle of self-defeat. Then I remembered that my clothes
actually fit better, and I'm moving better than a year ago. *Think
long-term*.

My self-defeatist attitude was debilitated by the fact that my right
shoulder's been hurting for the past month. Today, sure enough, it
started acting up again. A terrifying image flashed before my eyes, one
in which I was living with a chronically damaged shoulder.

I must keep going. The alternative is to sit at home and do nothing, and
that's what got me into the mess I'm in. Fatigue, trouble standing up
straight, overweight and immobile. One step at a time.

On the bright side, I learned a few things too. First, the right
shoulder hurts because it collapses forward, which happens because the
left side of the lower back isn't firing (due to a past injury). Fix the
lower back, get the right lat muscle firing, and the shoulder pain will
resolve.

Second, I've been noticing that my elocution---which has suffered
tremendously since Covid, in the sense that I mumble and sound
monotonous and languished---improves tremendously when I stand up with
symmetry. Standing up with symmetry just means that I'm loading both
feet equally. This isn't the case today, because of the aforementioned,
inactive lower back on one side. My torso tends to twist to the left.
Because of this I don't stand up straight, which leads to a neck that
rolls forward, throttled breathing and muffled speech. Fix the back!!

Seems like today is a day of realizations. I solved another problem
ailing me for years. The Android Auto in my car just wouldn't accept my
phone. It would accept every other phone we tried, just not mine. I even
switched phones, and still it refused to connect. I changed cables. I
deleted my phone from the car and reconnected. I played around with
Google's privacy settings on my phone. No change. For two years I've
been magnetically mounting my phone on the vents and using it directly
(what a tragedy, I know). I was venting to my partner today, and just
decided to factory reset the car system. After 10 minutes of waiting for
a factory reset---BOOM, the phone connected!

Thank you, Universe.

Dear Diary,

Today someone at the gym asked me what my biggest takeaways were after a
year of calisthenics. I was taken aback by the question, because I
didn't expect someone to ask me this seeing as I'm still visibly out of
shape. Having said that, the answer I gave him formed gradually, bit by
bit, after various iterations.

Here's what I said about my three biggest takeaways.

Consistency and persistence take precedence above all else. The body has
considerable momentum in a non-conducive direction coming in. It needs
small, repeating stimuli to change momentum in a more positive
direction. Show up even when you don't feel like it. Over time, you want
to be anywhere else.

Second, patience is an important virtue. Rome wasn't built in a day.
Having a long-term perspective is important, otherwise you'll get
demotivated. At first, I wanted to say I'm going to do this for a few
months. Then a year. Eventually I realized it's more important to
develop a habit than getting to a set of "six pack abs". Besides, even
if I somehow get to a set of six pack abs, and don't have a long-term
perspective, my old habits would take over anyways.

Third, it'll be tough to show up consistently if you're not having fun,
so invest in a sense of community. Build a network. Exchange
pleasantries. Trade comments and strategies. The community will keep you
coming back, tying into point number two above, of having a long-term
perspective.

Dear Diary,

I'm going through one of those "ebbing" phases, the ones where I find
myself waning into relaxation instead of driving forward. I am allowing
myself this waxing and waning, temporarily, so that I may return to the
"flowing" phase with vigour.

I must keep careful watch though. One day turns into two, two into
three, and before I know it, months go by being away from physical
activity.

I've been doing the rotational hip mobility exercises the chiropractor
gave me. It's been a week. In the gym I felt slightly more stability on
the plank, resulting in me holding the plank for longer this week. So
I'm optimistic this exercise will restore some of the imbalance I've
been suffering in my hips for the past few years.

The hamstring on the left side, which had been so tight and painful the
last week, is slowly being relieved. It's still tight, but I feel good
things are on their way.

Even though the wall handstands this week were difficult, with me hardly
being able to move closer to the wall, and my right shoulder hurting
afterwards, I feel there is more stability coming this way. On the
handstands I remained aware of keeping both hips balanced, and that
resulted in the right shoulder pulling more of its weight. Will have to
keep doing this.

I'll return to the gym soon.

## December 2023

Dear Diary,

I dropped the ball back in October, and have been making my way back
slowly and steadily since. It's funny how quickly time passes when
you're not in the gym, lounging on the couch, eating crap and being
hedonistic in general. It's funnier (not really) how much time slows
down when you're doing the heavy work of getting your ass to the gym
every day.

Every day, the struggle starts anew. I decided a while ago that I will
go into the gym everyday, with a day or two of rest as needed. It hasn't
been easy, every inch of my body hurts. But I decided to do this because
leaving gaps in between means even more pain when I get back into the
gym. It took me a year to figure this out.

I've noticed some positive changes in the last two months. In the gym
everyone knows me as 1) the bigger guy (I'm assuming, no one's implied
this), and 2) the flexible guy. My flexibility has improved in many
ways.

The other day someone fist-bumped me because he noticed how much weight
I've lost. A close friend commented I've dropped a lot of pounds. So
it's showing.

Strangely, the weighing machine still shows 111KGs. I suppose I've been
putting some muscle on, and the clothes are fitting better. Still feels
annoying that the gut is big, but these things take time. So gotta keep
patient.

I ended up seeing a chiropractor for the mobility issues in my left hip.
It's been two months and I haven't seen improvement from exercise alone.
The chiro told me my hips are very tight (which is strange, because I
have pretty good flexibility bending forwards), but rotational mobility
is quite weak. He gave me some stretches and exercises to do three times
a day. Let's see what happens.

## September 2023

Dear Diary,

It's already been a year. I renewed my membership to the calisthenics
gym for another year.

I haven't been consistent throughout the year. Rather, there are bursts
where I'm consistent for a few three-month legs in the year. The rest of
the months my motivation was dwindling, I was doubting myself, or I was
being plain lazy.

It's alright though, over the long run it's better to develop good
habits, which I'm doing.

If the pain gets too much, I won't want to be consistent anyways.

## August 2023

Dear Diary,

I have a nice ritual going. I listen to podcasts on the way to and from
the gym. The drive there and back are "me" times. I listen to the Lex
Fridman podcasts, or depending on my mood, Joe Rogan.

I'm noticing I'm starting to move better. I can hang for 60s now. Dips
are still hard, something feels off in my right shoulder. The Australian
push-ups are pretty tough still, can't get past 30 seconds. Planks are
pretty hard too but I know I'm progressing.

## May 2023

Just keep going. Just keep going.

## Jan 2023

Dear Diary,

Got back into it in the new year. I had given up in the past couple
months. I feel like such an odd person out at the gym. Even though
everyone's great, I know what everyone must be thinking.

Still, I've gotta remember what brought me to Calisthenics, and stay
committed. Small efforts, repeated, will complete any undertaking. One
step at a time is not too difficult.

## August 2022

The owner and instructor at [Ultimate
Calisthenics](https://uc-results.com/), Alex, asked me to take pictures
of myself regularly to track progress. I feel very vulnerable putting
these here... what if my boss sees it? What if my extended family sees
it?

Let them see. I'm a lion, right? Lions take risks.

Here's the first set of them.

After coming back from the Calisthenics gym, I feel very dejected. I saw
people with rock hard abs doing jumping lunges, iron crosses, ring
muscle-ups... and here I'm struggling to warm-up properly.

It's going to be a very long road.

Here are a few other excerpts from [*The Greatest Salesman In The
World*](https://www.amazon.ca/Greatest-Salesman-World-Og-Mandino/dp/055327757X)
that're keeping me going.

She's not wrong...

## (Still Later) July 2022

Dear Diary,

I've joined a Calisthenics gym. It's called [Ultimate
Calisthenics](https://uc-results.com/) and is located in Toronto. Wish
me best.

Love,

## (Later) July 2022

Dear Diary,

Here are some videos of things I want to be able to do.

I'll look for some Calisthenics gyms near me.

## July 2022

Dear Diary,

Something needs to change.

My body feels like a prison. It lacks the most basic range of motion
required to accomplish the simplest tasks. I get drained so easily. From
meditating and body scanning, I notice unpleasant sensations arising
more often than when I was in better shape.

It goes without saying I don't like how the person looking back at me
from the mirror looks. This affects my confidence. My confidence affects
my performance at work and in my relationships. I'm not applying myself
fully.

A throttled body doesn't express itself well. When one doesn't express
oneself with high fidelity, other people don't lean in. So constipated
expressiveness is reducing my ability to persuade others. This is
shortening my radius of impact.

At a mental level, I lack the persistence, drive and endurance to last
long enough to accomplish anything of substance. I'm living life in the
short-term. I'm letting the winds of life move me as they please.

Something needs to change.

The following excerpt from a book that Matthew McConaughey recommended
resonated with me.

> "I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure
> course through my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my
> shepherd. I am a lion, and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with
> the sheep. I will hear not those who weep and complain, for their
> disease is contagious. Let them join the sheep. The slaughterhouse of
> failure is not my destiny."

Enough weeping and complaining. Time for some action.

Love,
Jawad
