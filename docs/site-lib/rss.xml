I turn thirty tomorrow. As yet another decade rolls to an end, I find
myself looking back and wondering: what lessons has it taught? For me,
this is a question worthy of pause and reflection. What follows is my
attempt at articulating insights I have at thirty that I didn't have at
twenty.1. Learning the Fundamentals
According to The Defining Decade, our twenties hold the potential for
rapid development. This is one of two developmental phases everyone goes
through (the other is during infancy). Now is the time to start learning
about the world, not by twiddling about with hallucinated hypotheses,
but rather by interacting with the world direclty to get some valuable
feedback. Maybe this means taking more risks, as we gradually let go of
inhibitions learned previously. The more feedback we get, the better we
can model how the world works. Gradually, reckless risk-taking becomes
calculated risk-taking.Certain fundamentals deserve our attention early, because the sooner we
tend to them the more intelligently we can use the limited resource of
time. For example:
Learning about the underpinnings of wealth-creation can help us jump
earlier onto the compound interest bandwagon.
Expanding our inter-personal and intra-personal intelligences can
help us create and sustain healthier long-term relationships.
Maintaining our bodies is a habit best developed early. In my
twenties I thought I could justify a decade of indulgence because my
body did not complain at the time-but it doesn't work like that. The
debts pile up and compound too. The last thing anyone wants is to
reach the gates of their thirties only to be greeted by an
insurmountable pile of health debt.
2. Learning by way of experimentation
Once I dove into curiosity-driven inquiry, I inadvertently began to
level-up:
I took improv and standup comedy lessons (I even ended up doing a
comedy set) which made me realize I actually like being around
people.
I set forth into the vast, intimidating world of dating, persevered,
and eventually met my partner of five years.
I attempted a startup making wearable devices to track form during
workouts - and left a year and a half later once I realized I was
missing important industry experience.
I chose to---consciously---bungee jump off a 200ft high cliff over a
spring lagoon, falling for about eight seconds, three of which were
in free fall. Doing so brought me confidence that I can let go when
I need to.
I made it through a ten-day silent meditation course, and walked out
with extraordinary tools to explore my awareness.
Even the range of music I listen to expanded. I'm not phenomenal at any
of these endeavours, but I know enough to not be in unconscious
ignorance.3. Forging alliances with the right therapist
It's possible to make it on our own, but working alongside others has
the advantage that we grow quicker. People who are close to us in some
ways reflect us to ourselves; the way they react to us (and why) carries
information about our behaviour.Now take this information, put it on steroids, and now we have what a
good therapist can do for us. Not only does such an individual
understand better than most people how the human mind works, but thanks
to interactions with dozens of personalities across a large segment of
the population, they also have reams of case studies pertaining to life
choices and how they played out.I've had profound realizations after hearing my therapist rephrase the
language I use to present problems, and juxtapose them with how others
solved it. It takes some trial and error to find the right therapist,
but it's worth the find. I don't go to a therapist because I feel
there's something wrong with my mind; I go so I can learn how it works.4. Reframing the&nbsp;past
The more we observe our actions and the more actions that we observe,
the more we start becoming aware of the causality in our lives. In my
adolescence I had difficulty opening up because I was bullied as a
child; when no one came to help, I attributed this to a lack of self
worth. As a teenager I was overweight, which had social consequences. My
parents were obsessed with my grades-so much so that I feared not being
top of the class.My twenties brought a more mature lens on the basis of which I could
begin to reframe my past. If I hadn't been bullied, I wouldn't have
known what an abuse of power feels like. Being overweight inspired me to
learn the fundamentals of movement, prompting me to invest in a
professional trainer. And my parents' persistence with my grades paved
my way into one of the finest engineering schools in North America.In our twenties we start to identify the sources of our habit patterns.
Gradually, we delineate our voice amidst the din of a million other
voices. We begin to understand that personality can be designed-so we
need not remain stuck in the habit patterns of the past. This is
liberating to discover.5. Cultivating a support&nbsp;network
At twenty, I was determined to get by on my own. I would keep to myself
and rarely open up. Had you met me then, you would've noticed the
heavily furrowed eyebrows and the missing grin. It wasn't until I risked
vulnerability and ventured into the unknown that I was acquainted with
'my tribe'. When the going gets tough, and that weight in my stomach
just won't go, it helps to know I'm not in this alone. A support system
is just that: a system that supports you when you need it - and laying
down its roots begins (at least) in the twenties.6. Focusing on what needs to&nbsp;grow
There's no free lunch. We can't experience the depth of a long,
monogamous relationship while also seeking the thrill and adventure of
the next sexual partner. A desk job brings stability at the cost of
choice in tasks. A startup can empower one to solve a complex problem at
the price of imbalance in other dimensions in one's life.Everything has a cost; I may not have sensed it at the time, but that's
only because the length of time for the cost to manifest itself had not
yet come to pass. If I'm doing better than someone else in my career, it
doesn't necessarily mean I have answers they don't; I may have simply
chosen to focus on a different path. Perhaps others chose to focus on
family, or doing a startup, or taking time off to go on an adventure;
what they are growing might bear fruit in their 30s and 40s. As my
career counsellor once told me: what we focus on grows.So there it is. That's what's going through my head as I stand at the
precipice of my twenties. As so many have told me, the past is to learn
from, and my twenties have certainly brought learning.Now onto discovering what the thirties are going to be about.
