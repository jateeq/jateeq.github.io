As yet another decade rolls to an end, I find\nmyself looking back and wondering: what lessons has it taught? For me,\nthis is a question worthy of pause and reflection. What follows is my\nattempt at articulating insights I have at thirty that I didn't have at\ntwenty.1. Learning the Fundamentals\nAccording to The Defining Decade, our twenties hold the potential for\nrapid development. This is one of two developmental phases everyone goes\nthrough (the other is during infancy). Now is the time to start learning\nabout the world, not by twiddling about with hallucinated hypotheses,\nbut rather by interacting with the world direclty to get some valuable\nfeedback. Maybe this means taking more risks, as we gradually let go of\ninhibitions learned previously. The more feedback we get, the better we\ncan model how the world works. Gradually, reckless risk-taking becomes\ncalculated risk-taking.Certain fundamentals deserve our attention early, because the sooner we\ntend to them the more intelligently we can use the limited resource of\ntime. For example:\nLearning about the underpinnings of wealth-creation can help us jump\nearlier onto the compound interest bandwagon.\nExpanding our inter-personal and intra-personal intelligences can\nhelp us create and sustain healthier long-term relationships.\nMaintaining our bodies is a habit best developed early. In my\ntwenties I thought I could justify a decade of indulgence because my\nbody did not complain at the time-but it doesn't work like that. The\ndebts pile up and compound too. The last thing anyone wants is to\nreach the gates of their thirties only to be greeted by an\ninsurmountable pile of health debt.\n2. Learning by way of experimentation\nOnce I dove into curiosity-driven inquiry, I inadvertently began to\nlevel-up:\nI took improv and standup comedy lessons (I even ended up doing a\ncomedy set) which made me realize I actually like being around\npeople.\nI set forth into the vast, intimidating world of dating, persevered,\nand eventually met my partner of five years.\nI attempted a startup making wearable devices to track form during\nworkouts - and left a year and a half later once I realized I was\nmissing important industry experience.\nI chose to---consciously---bungee jump off a 200ft high cliff over a\nspring lagoon, falling for about eight seconds, three of which were\nin free fall. Doing so brought me confidence that I can let go when\nI need to.\nI made it through a ten-day silent meditation course, and walked out\nwith extraordinary tools to explore my awareness.\nEven the range of music I listen to expanded. I'm not phenomenal at any\nof these endeavours, but I know enough to not be in unconscious\nignorance.3. Forging alliances with the right therapist\nIt's possible to make it on our own, but working alongside others has\nthe advantage that we grow quicker. People who are close to us in some\nways reflect us to ourselves; the way they react to us (and why) carries\ninformation about our behaviour.Now take this information, put it on steroids, and now we have what a\ngood therapist can do for us. Not only does such an individual\nunderstand better than most people how the human mind works, but thanks\nto interactions with dozens of personalities across a large segment of\nthe population, they also have reams of case studies pertaining to life\nchoices and how they played out.I've had profound realizations after hearing my therapist rephrase the\nlanguage I use to present problems, and juxtapose them with how others\nsolved it. It takes some trial and error to find the right therapist,\nbut it's worth the find. I don't go to a therapist because I feel\nthere's something wrong with my mind; I go so I can learn how it works.4. Reframing the&nbsp;past\nThe more we observe our actions and the more actions that we observe,\nthe more we start becoming aware of the causality in our lives. In my\nadolescence I had difficulty opening up because I was bullied as a\nchild; when no one came to help, I attributed this to a lack of self\nworth. As a teenager I was overweight, which had social consequences. My\nparents were obsessed with my grades-so much so that I feared not being\ntop of the class.My twenties brought a more mature lens on the basis of which I could\nbegin to reframe my past. If I hadn't been bullied, I wouldn't have\nknown what an abuse of power feels like. Being overweight inspired me to\nlearn the fundamentals of movement, prompting me to invest in a\nprofessional trainer. And my parents' persistence with my grades paved\nmy way into one of the finest engineering schools in North America.In our twenties we start to identify the sources of our habit patterns.\nGradually, we delineate our voice amidst the din of a million other\nvoices. We begin to understand that personality can be designed-so we\nneed not remain stuck in the habit patterns of the past. This is\nliberating to discover.5. Cultivating a support&nbsp;network\nAt twenty, I was determined to get by on my own. I would keep to myself\nand rarely open up. Had you met me then, you would've noticed the\nheavily furrowed eyebrows and the missing grin. It wasn't until I risked\nvulnerability and ventured into the unknown that I was acquainted with\n'my tribe'. When the going gets tough, and that weight in my stomach\njust won't go, it helps to know I'm not in this alone. A support system\nis just that: a system that supports you when you need it - and laying\ndown its roots begins (at least) in the twenties.6. Focusing on what needs to&nbsp;grow\nThere's no free lunch. We can't experience the depth of a long,\nmonogamous relationship while also seeking the thrill and adventure of\nthe next sexual partner. A desk job brings stability at the cost of\nchoice in tasks. A startup can empower one to solve a complex problem at\nthe price of imbalance in other dimensions in one's life.Everything has a cost; I may not have sensed it at the time, but that's\nonly because the length of time for the cost to manifest itself had not\nyet come to pass. If I'm doing better than someone else in my career, it\ndoesn't necessarily mean I have answers they don't; I may have simply\nchosen to focus on a different path. Perhaps others chose to focus on\nfamily, or doing a startup, or taking time off to go on an adventure;\nwhat they are growing might bear fruit in their 30s and 40s. As my\ncareer counsellor once told me: what we focus on grows.So there it is. That's what's going through my head as I stand at the\nprecipice of my twenties. As so many have told me, the past is to learn\nfrom, and my twenties have certainly brought learning.Now onto discovering what the thirties are going to be about.\n::::::
