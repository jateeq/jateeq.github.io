Wow.Not sure what to make of it. My gut reaction was to spiral into a\nviscious cycle of self-defeat. Then I remembered that my clothes\nactually fit better, and I'm moving better than a year ago. Think\nlong-term.My self-defeatist attitude was debilitated by the fact that my right\nshoulder's been hurting for the past month. Today, sure enough, it\nstarted acting up again. A terrifying image flashed before my eyes, one\nin which I was living with a chronically damaged shoulder.I must keep going. The alternative is to sit at home and do nothing, and\nthat's what got me into the mess I'm in. Fatigue, trouble standing up\nstraight, overweight and immobile. One step at a time.On the bright side, I learned a few things too. First, the right\nshoulder hurts because it collapses forward, which happens because the\nleft side of the lower back isn't firing (due to a past injury). Fix the\nlower back, get the right lat muscle firing, and the shoulder pain will\nresolve.Second, I've been noticing that my elocution---which has suffered\ntremendously since Covid, in the sense that I mumble and sound\nmonotonous and languished---improves tremendously when I stand up with\nsymmetry. Standing up with symmetry just means that I'm loading both\nfeet equally. This isn't the case today, because of the aforementioned,\ninactive lower back on one side. My torso tends to twist to the left.\nBecause of this I don't stand up straight, which leads to a neck that\nrolls forward, throttled breathing and muffled speech. Fix the back!!Seems like today is a day of realizations. I solved another problem\nailing me for years. The Android Auto in my car just wouldn't accept my\nphone. It would accept every other phone we tried, just not mine. I even\nswitched phones, and still it refused to connect. I changed cables. I\ndeleted my phone from the car and reconnected. I played around with\nGoogle's privacy settings on my phone. No change. For two years I've\nbeen magnetically mounting my phone on the vents and using it directly\n(what a tragedy, I know). I was venting to my partner today, and just\ndecided to factory reset the car system. After 10 minutes of waiting for\na factory reset---BOOM, the phone connected!Thank you, Universe.January 15, 2024Dear Diary,Today someone at the gym asked me what my biggest takeaways were after a\nyear of calisthenics. I was taken aback by the question, because I\ndidn't expect someone to ask me this seeing as I'm still visibly out of\nshape. Having said that, the answer I gave him formed gradually, bit by\nbit, after various iterations.Here's what I said about my three biggest takeaways.Consistency and persistence take precedence above all else. The body has\nconsiderable momentum in a non-conducive direction coming in. It needs\nsmall, repeating stimuli to change momentum in a more positive\ndirection. Show up even when you don't feel like it. Over time, you want\nto be anywhere else.Second, patience is an important virtue. Rome wasn't built in a day.\nHaving a long-term perspective is important, otherwise you'll get\ndemotivated. At first, I wanted to say I'm going to do this for a few\nmonths. Then a year. Eventually I realized it's more important to\ndevelop a habit than getting to a set of \"six pack abs\". Besides, even\nif I somehow get to a set of six pack abs, and don't have a long-term\nperspective, my old habits would take over anyways.Third, it'll be tough to show up consistently if you're not having fun,\nso invest in a sense of community. Build a network. Exchange\npleasantries. Trade comments and strategies. The community will keep you\ncoming back, tying into point number two above, of having a long-term\nperspective.January 10, 2024Dear Diary,I'm going through one of those \"ebbing\" phases, the ones where I find\nmyself waning into relaxation instead of driving forward. I am allowing\nmyself this waxing and waning, temporarily, so that I may return to the\n\"flowing\" phase with vigour.I must keep careful watch though. One day turns into two, two into\nthree, and before I know it, months go by being away from physical\nactivity.I've been doing the rotational hip mobility exercises the chiropractor\ngave me. It's been a week. In the gym I felt slightly more stability on\nthe plank, resulting in me holding the plank for longer this week. So\nI'm optimistic this exercise will restore some of the imbalance I've\nbeen suffering in my hips for the past few years.The hamstring on the left side, which had been so tight and painful the\nlast week, is slowly being releaved. It's still tight, but I feel good\nthings are on their way.Even though the wall handstands this week were difficult, with me hardly\nbeing able to move closer to the wall, and my right shoulder hurting\nafterwards, I feel there is more stability coming this way. On the\nhandstands I remained aware of keeping both hips balanced, and that\nresulted in the right shoulder pulling more of its weight. Will have to\nkeep doing this.I'll return to the gym soon.December 2023Dear Diary,I dropped the ball back in October, and have been making my way back\nslowly and steadily since. It's funny how quickly time passes when\nyou're not in the gym, lounging on the couch, eating crap and being\nhedonistic in general. It's funnier (not really) how much time slows\ndown when you're doing the heavy work of getting your ass to the gym\nevery day.Every day, the struggle starts anew. I decided a while ago that I will\ngo into the gym everyday, with a day or two of rest as needed. It hasn't\nbeen easy, every inch of my body hurts. But I decided to do this because\nleaving gaps in between means even more pain when I get back into the\ngym. It took me a year to figure this out.::: img_row<br>\n<img src=\"https://jawadateeq-images.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/physical_fitness_journey/20231222/front.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">{.img_dimensions}<br>\n<img src=\"https://jawadateeq-images.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/physical_fitness_journey/20231222/side.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">{.img_dimensions}<br>\n<img src=\"https://jawadateeq-images.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/physical_fitness_journey/20231222/back.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">{.img_dimensions}\n:::I've noticed some positive changes in the last two months. In the gym\neveryone knows me as 1) the bigger guy (I'm assuming, no one's implied\nthis), and 2) the flexible guy. My flexibility has improved in many\nways.The other day someone fist-bumped me because he noticed how much weight\nI've lost. A close friend commented I've dropped a lot of pounds. So\nit's showing.Strangely, the weighing machine still shows 111KGs. I suppose I've been\nputting some muscle on, and the clothes are fitting better. Still feels\nannoying that the gut is big, but these things take time. So gotta keep\npatient.I ended up seeing a chiropractor for the mobility issues in my left hip.\nIt's been two months and I haven't seen improvement from exercise alone.\nThe chiro told me my hips are very tight (which is strange, because I\nhave pretty good flexibility bending forwards), but rotational mobility\nis quite weak. He gave me some stretches and exercises to do three times\na day. Let's see what happens.September 2023Dear Diary,It's already been a year. I renewed my membership to the calisthenics\ngym for another year.I haven't been consistent throughout the year. Rather, there are bursts\nwhere I'm consistent for a few three-month legs in the year. The rest of\nthe months my motivation was dwindling, I was doubting myself, or I was\nbeing plain lazy.It's alright though, over the long run it's better to develop good\nhabits, which I'm doing.If the pain gets too much, I won't want to be consistent anyways.August 2023Dear Diary,I have a nice ritual going. I listen to podcasts on the way to and from\nthe gym. The drive there and back are \"me\" times. I listen to the Lex\nFridman podcasts, or depending on my mood, Joe Rogan.::: img_row<br>\n<img src=\"https://jawadateeq-images.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/physical_fitness_journey/20230813/front.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">{.img_dimensions}<br>\n<img src=\"https://jawadateeq-images.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/physical_fitness_journey/20230813/side.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">{.img_dimensions}<br>\n<img src=\"https://jawadateeq-images.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/physical_fitness_journey/20230813/back.jpg\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">{.img_dimensions}\n:::I'm noticing I'm starting to move better.

This affects my confidence. My confidence affects\nmy performance at work and in my relationships. I'm not applying myself\nfully.A throttled body doesn't express itself well. When one doesn't express\noneself with high fidelity, other people don't lean in. So constipated\nexpressiveness is reducing my ability to persuade others. This is\nshortening my raidus of impact.At a mental level, I lack the persistence, drive and endurance to last\nlong enough to accomplish anything of substance. I'm living life in the\nshort-term. I'm letting the winds of life move me as they please.Something needs to change.The following excerpt from a book that Matthew McConaughey recommended\nresonated with me.\n\"I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure\ncoarse through my veins. I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my\nshepherd. I am a lion, and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with\nthe sheep. I will hear not those who weep and complain, for their\ndisease is contagious. Let them join the sheep. The slaughterhouse of\nfailure is not my destiney.\"\n--- Scroll III, The Greatest Salesman In The World.\nEnough weeping and complaining. Time for some action.Love,\nJawad\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: share\n:::\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As yet another decade rolls to an end, I find\nmyself looking back and wondering: what lessons has it taught? For me,\nthis is a question worthy of pause and reflection. What follows is my\nattempt at articulating insights I have at thirty that I didn't have at\ntwenty.1. Learning the Fundamentals\nAccording to The Defining Decade, our twenties hold the potential for\nrapid development. This is one of two developmental phases everyone goes\nthrough (the other is during infancy). Now is the time to start learning\nabout the world, not by twiddling about with hallucinated hypotheses,\nbut rather by interacting with the world direclty to get some valuable\nfeedback. Maybe this means taking more risks, as we gradually let go of\ninhibitions learned previously. The more feedback we get, the better we\ncan model how the world works. Gradually, reckless risk-taking becomes\ncalculated risk-taking.Certain fundamentals deserve our attention early, because the sooner we\ntend to them the more intelligently we can use the limited resource of\ntime. For example:\nLearning about the underpinnings of wealth-creation can help us jump\nearlier onto the compound interest bandwagon.\nExpanding our inter-personal and intra-personal intelligences can\nhelp us create and sustain healthier long-term relationships.\nMaintaining our bodies is a habit best developed early. In my\ntwenties I thought I could justify a decade of indulgence because my\nbody did not complain at the time-but it doesn't work like that. The\ndebts pile up and compound too. The last thing anyone wants is to\nreach the gates of their thirties only to be greeted by an\ninsurmountable pile of health debt.\n2. Learning by way of experimentation\nOnce I dove into curiosity-driven inquiry, I inadvertently began to\nlevel-up:\nI took improv and standup comedy lessons (I even ended up doing a\ncomedy set) which made me realize I actually like being around\npeople.\nI set forth into the vast, intimidating world of dating, persevered,\nand eventually met my partner of five years.\nI attempted a startup making wearable devices to track form during\nworkouts - and left a year and a half later once I realized I was\nmissing important industry experience.\nI chose to---consciously---bungee jump off a 200ft high cliff over a\nspring lagoon, falling for about eight seconds, three of which were\nin free fall. Doing so brought me confidence that I can let go when\nI need to.\nI made it through a ten-day silent meditation course, and walked out\nwith extraordinary tools to explore my awareness.\nEven the range of music I listen to expanded. I'm not phenomenal at any\nof these endeavours, but I know enough to not be in unconscious\nignorance.3. Forging alliances with the right therapist\nIt's possible to make it on our own, but working alongside others has\nthe advantage that we grow quicker. People who are close to us in some\nways reflect us to ourselves; the way they react to us (and why) carries\ninformation about our behaviour.Now take this information, put it on steroids, and now we have what a\ngood therapist can do for us. Not only does such an individual\nunderstand better than most people how the human mind works, but thanks\nto interactions with dozens of personalities across a large segment of\nthe population, they also have reams of case studies pertaining to life\nchoices and how they played out.I've had profound realizations after hearing my therapist rephrase the\nlanguage I use to present problems, and juxtapose them with how others\nsolved it. It takes some trial and error to find the right therapist,\nbut it's worth the find. I don't go to a therapist because I feel\nthere's something wrong with my mind; I go so I can learn how it works.4. Reframing the&nbsp;past\nThe more we observe our actions and the more actions that we observe,\nthe more we start becoming aware of the causality in our lives. In my\nadolescence I had difficulty opening up because I was bullied as a\nchild; when no one came to help, I attributed this to a lack of self\nworth. As a teenager I was overweight, which had social consequences. My\nparents were obsessed with my grades-so much so that I feared not being\ntop of the class.My twenties brought a more mature lens on the basis of which I could\nbegin to reframe my past. If I hadn't been bullied, I wouldn't have\nknown what an abuse of power feels like. Being overweight inspired me to\nlearn the fundamentals of movement, prompting me to invest in a\nprofessional trainer. And my parents' persistence with my grades paved\nmy way into one of the finest engineering schools in North America.In our twenties we start to identify the sources of our habit patterns.\nGradually, we delineate our voice amidst the din of a million other\nvoices. We begin to understand that personality can be designed-so we\nneed not remain stuck in the habit patterns of the past. This is\nliberating to discover.5. Cultivating a support&nbsp;network\nAt twenty, I was determined to get by on my own. I would keep to myself\nand rarely open up. Had you met me then, you would've noticed the\nheavily furrowed eyebrows and the missing grin. It wasn't until I risked\nvulnerability and ventured into the unknown that I was acquainted with\n'my tribe'. When the going gets tough, and that weight in my stomach\njust won't go, it helps to know I'm not in this alone. A support system\nis just that: a system that supports you when you need it - and laying\ndown its roots begins (at least) in the twenties.6. Focusing on what needs to&nbsp;grow\nThere's no free lunch. We can't experience the depth of a long,\nmonogamous relationship while also seeking the thrill and adventure of\nthe next sexual partner. A desk job brings stability at the cost of\nchoice in tasks. A startup can empower one to solve a complex problem at\nthe price of imbalance in other dimensions in one's life.Everything has a cost; I may not have sensed it at the time, but that's\nonly because the length of time for the cost to manifest itself had not\nyet come to pass. If I'm doing better than someone else in my career, it\ndoesn't necessarily mean I have answers they don't; I may have simply\nchosen to focus on a different path. Perhaps others chose to focus on\nfamily, or doing a startup, or taking time off to go on an adventure;\nwhat they are growing might bear fruit in their 30s and 40s. As my\ncareer counsellor once told me: what we focus on grows.So there it is. That's what's going through my head as I stand at the\nprecipice of my twenties. As so many have told me, the past is to learn\nfrom, and my twenties have certainly brought learning.Now onto discovering what the thirties are going to be about.\n:::::: share\n:::\n::::::\n:::::::\n::::::::::::::: container\n::: site-title-wrapper<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#\" href=\"jawadateeq.com/blog/twenties.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"></a>{.button-square .button-jump-top .js-jump-top\naria-label=\"Back to Top\"}\n:::<br>© 2024 / Powered by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://gohugo.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_self\">Hugo</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ghostwriter theme</a> By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" target=\"_self\">JollyGoodThemes</a> /<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ported</a> to Hugo By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub\" target=\"_self\">jbub</a>\n::::","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq_.site-title}_0"},{"heading":"What I Learned From My Twenties {#what-i-learned-from-my-twenties .post-title}","level":1,"id":"What_I_Learned_From_My_Twenties_{#what-i-learned-from-my-twenties_.post-title}_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq-1 .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq-1_.site-title}_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:blog/post",".html",".html","jawadateeq.com/blog/twenties.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"jawadateeq.com/blog/twenties.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740105178702,"modifiedTime":1740108125420,"sourceSize":7781,"sourcePath":"jawadateeq.com/Blog/twenties.md","exportPath":"jawadateeq.com/blog/twenties.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"jawadateeq.com/blog/vipassana.html":{"title":"vipassana","icon":"","description":"<a href=\".?query=tag:blog/post\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#blog/post\">#blog/post</a>:::\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Posts</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/stories/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stories</a>\n::::\n:::::\n::::::: {#container}\n:::::: container\n::: post-header:::::: {.post-content .clearfix}\nWhy should I meditate?I get this question often. My response: one doesn't need to find\nmeditation, let it find you when you need it.If you don't have a problem, why solve it? Besides, meditation is one of\nthose things that you only realize the benefit of after significant\nup-front investment. It's unusual for someone to invest in something\nthey don't understand the rewards of.Even once I explain what I got out of meditation, many don't find\nmeditation appealing. Improve concentration? I don't need that, I have\ngood focus. I have to stay still in one place for some time? No thanks.\nI have to be remain silent? Count me out. I have to pay attention to\n\"the sensations\" that are arising in my body? Get the f*** out.To be fair, it's very difficult to explain the benefits of meditation,\nbecause I don't have the words to describe it. Our language is based on\nthe five senses, and meditation is trying to transport us beyond these.\nYou may have heard this referred to as the \"inner world\".I can only speak for my own experiences. After practicing Vipassana for\nsome time, I've become more attuned to how I'm feeling. I've become more\naware of when I'm \"bull-shitting\" myself and others, and when I'm\ncreating drama in my relationships (and why). It's strange; there are\ntimes when I am arguing and I can see myself from above myself and know\nthat I'm only trying to avoid the pain of being wrong, or looking\nstupid, or having to apologize for a mistake I made. I know this sounds\nlike basic life skills, but before I practiced Vipassana I would've\nreacted without this awareness.I've also become more sensitive to the intentions of others around me. I\nfind I can be more tactful because I understand how someone else must be\nfeeling.I've started paying attention to the causality of things... what led to\nthis particular event? What triggered it? What were the parameters in\nquestion? The flip side of this is: what will this action lead to? Such\nunderstanding of causality is key for learning from mistakes and making\nsound decisions.I've also realized that once we express something as an action, we are\nsowing a trigger for the action to happen again. This works both ways,\nwhether the action has pleasant or unpleasnat consequences. Basically,\nour actions are not memoryless systems. What we do sows the seed for who\nwe are likely to do (and therfore who we are likely to be) in the\nfuture.There's another aspect of what I've experienced with Vipassana, but I'm\nnot sure how to explain it (or what to make of those experience). I have\nhad experiences where I've \"dissolved\" into everything else. There's\nsome loss of the notion of \"Jawad\". I'm aware of \"I\", but the \"I\"\nbecomes less important than the awarenss of what's being experienced.I call these \"spiritual\" experiences, because \"sprituality\" implies\nbeyond the world of senses, and such experiences beckon me to consider\nthe world beyond the signals (senses) received by the \"I\".In truth, I haven't been diligent with practicing Vipassana (a.k.a\nInsight Meditation) consistently. And consistency here, as with so many\nother aspects of life, is key. While practicing consistently is still a\ngoal, I find that I'm still able to get into the meditation after being\naway from it for some time. It's like muscle memory; the more one has\npracticed a physical movement pattern, the more likely they are to be\nable to repeat it.I learned Vipassana at a silent meditation retreat. For ten days,\nparticipants are asked to take a vow of silence, and to live a life\nsimilar to Buddhist monks, by taking the following \"precepts\": 1) no\nlying, 2) no killing, 3) no sexual activity, 4) no stealing and 5) no\nintoxicants. The no talking part takes care of 1. Precept 2 was pretty\neasy---except when the mosquitos came along.The retreat was located an hour north of Toronto, an area called\nInnisville. This is a fairly secluded area, far away from Torontonian\nhustle and bustle. There's a lot of stillness in this part of nature,\nand that stillness tends to instill humans as well. Stillness is good.\nThe analogy many spiritual masters give is as follows. If one looks into\nturbulent water, the depths remain murky. But with stillness one can see\nthrough to the depths. That's why meditation is more than a tool for\nconcentration. It's a vehicle to help you peer deeply into yourself, see\nwhat you're made of.In this secluded forest were situated a few wooden structures, some one\nstorey high and others two-storeyed. The two-storeyed sturctures were\nwhere the dwelling rooms were, with two people to a room. The structures\nfor men and women were separated. I wonder where persons of\nnon-traditional gender identity reside.The other structures were for the kitched, and another for the\nmeditation hall. The meditation hall was a large, open space, sheltered\nand usually dark, with a slightly raised platform at the front for\n\"teachers\". The rest of the hall was flat and carpeted (IIRC). We would\nuse yoga mats and cushions on the floor to meditate. Some people used\nchairs.Each day we woke up at 4:30 am to the sound of a tolling bell. We would\nhead out of our rooms, make our way down to clean up, and then head over\nto the meditation hall under the as-yet star-lit sky. Here we would\nmeditate for an hour and a half before another tolling bell would\nannounce breakfast was served in the kitchen.The food (and everything else) was compeletely free. Participants are\nfree to make a donation after they leave but it's not necessary. The\nfood is vegetarian. The authorities insist this is to keep costs low,\nbut I found this diet to be very energizing compared to may daily meal.\nIt was very simple food, whole, unprocessed food, and I was surprised by\nhow easily it passed through my system. Sadly I haven't been able to\nstick to that kind of a diet with my family. Something I want to do more\nof day-to-day.It was strange at first to eat and not talk to anyone, let alone make\neye contact. I could see everyone else heading in and out of the\nkitchen, and lining up after one another. I could see the volunteer\nservers preparing and laying out the food arrangements. But everything\nhappened without a single word uttered. The silence is defeaning at\nfirst but I soon grew accustomed to it. In fact, once the outer world is\nsilent, the inner world starts to become noticeable. What's noticeable\ncan be observed, followed, and eventually \"engineered\" (or\nreverse-engineered).After breakfast, we headed back to the meditation hall for an hour and a\nhalf of guided meditation. The rest of the day was comprised of such\nhour-and-a-half chunks of group meditation with a few minutes of break\nin between. All said, we meditated for 11 hours a day. It's very\ndifficult not to notice what's going on within oneself after sitting\nstill and observing oneself for 11 hours, day days straight. I noticed\nmy own agitation start to spring up after day 4.At 12 we had lunch (of course, announced by the bell that tolls), and at\n5pm we had tea. After this, there would be no food until breakfast the\nnext day. I was concerned at first, but quickly realized that eating\nactually makes meditation harder. It's easier to meditate on an empty\nstomach. The body just seems to be more readable without the distraction\nof food-processing happening within. Again, sadly, I haven't quite been\nable to take this back with me into my life. I tend to abuse food and\nuse it as a reward mechanism. Much left wanting here.At 8pm there's the final group meditation, which involves a lecture\ncovering the \"theory\" behind what was practiced that day. First we\npracticed, then we understood the widsom behind the practice. I liked\nit. Having been to engineering school, I wonder whether I'd have learned\nbetter this way.The lectures were delievered by S. N. Goenka and are avaiable on<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7QHNvNFfA&amp;list=PLPJVlVRVmhc4Z01fD57jbzycm9I6W054x\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz7QHNvNFfA&amp;list=PLPJVlVRVmhc4Z01fD57jbzycm9I6W054x\" target=\"_self\">youtube</a>.\nI had the option of viewing these before I went to the retreat, but\ndecided not to. I'm glad with the decision. I think I would've judged\nthe quality of the video, or misunderstood some of the ideas therein\nwithout having experienced it myself. Needless to say, these lectures\nblew my mind. Regardless of whether the ideas were fact or fiction, the\nideas themselves were fascinating.The meditation itself was divided into two phases. The first phase of\nthe meditation was a breathing-based exercise called \"Ana Pana\", which\nrefers to the breath going in and out of the nostrils. This meditation\nwas about bringing our attention to the triangle formed from the top of\nthe nose at its apex, and the upper lip at the base. As the breath\ntravels in and out, it touches the upper lip. We were asked to pay\nattention to the nature of the breath when it enters and leaves. It's\ntemperature, it's feel, it's volume, it's frequency. The idea here was\nto prepare us for body-scanning (the second phase). Since this\ntriangular area is small, it helps prepare us for eventually\nbody-scanning the entire body by taking baby steps.The second phase is Vipassana meditation. What we did with the upper\nlip, we would not do with the entire body. Starting with the crown of\nthe head, we would take each \"patch\" of our skin and rest our attention\nthere for a few seconds, noticing what sensations are present.\nItchiness, numbness, large unnoticeable patches, small very noticeable\npatches, tickles, hot, cold... whatever was going on, the goal was to\njust observe, without judging the sensation.The underlying wisdom in this practice is that all our actions stem from\nsensations. There's a closed feedback loop between our environment and\nus, and if we don't pay attention to this loop that we, being creatures\nof habit, will habitually react to our environment. Thus our environment\nwill contorl us. To break this loop, we prevent the cycle from\ncompleting. The loops looks as follows.First a trigger occurs in the environment. Our senses pick this up and\nsend out, hint hint, a sense-ation. Our perceptive centers judge the\nsensation as pleasant or unpleasant, based on a few factors, including\npast experiences. How we react to a sensation will be recorded in this\nperceptive center, which is why our actions are so important. This is\nhow trauma is stored in the body. Positive learning is also stored in\nthe body (that's a fire, I mustn't touch it!). The goal is not to\nindiscriminately forget all the past. The goal is to not react to the\nsensations that are coming up, but to be able to look at them anew and\nmake the right decisions in the present.The point at which we can break the feedback loop is when the sensation\nis first noticed. If we don't notice it, the perceptive center will\nautomatically judge it and create a reaction. But if we can sense the\nsensation, remain equanamous (neither develop an attachment or an\naversion to it), we start to weaken the judgement, or labelling, around\nthat sensation. The next time that sensation comes up, we're more likely\nto be robust to it, and instead of reacting unconsciously, repsond to it\nconsciously.This was so long ago, but I still remember being there vividly. I'll try\ndo another one of these retreats soon, they really do transform you.\nThey're not the easiest thing to do, especially when you come out of a\nsecluded, quiet forest and into a bustling city like Toront which is\npregnant with sound. It can be a lot. But these excursions made me\nrealize that there's so much unconsciousness in my life and if I am to\ngrow beyond my current condition, I must weaken the hold that my\nenvironment has on me.\n:::::: share\n:::\n::::::\n:::::::\n::::::::::::::: container\n::: site-title-wrapper<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#\" href=\"jawadateeq.com/blog/vipassana.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"></a>{.button-square .button-jump-top .js-jump-top\naria-label=\"Back to Top\"}\n:::<br>© 2024 / Powered by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://gohugo.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_self\">Hugo</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ghostwriter theme</a> By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" target=\"_self\">JollyGoodThemes</a> /<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ported</a> to Hugo By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub\" target=\"_self\">jbub</a>\n::::","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq_.site-title}_0"},{"heading":"Vipassana {#vipassana .post-title}","level":1,"id":"Vipassana_{#vipassana_.post-title}_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq-1 .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq-1_.site-title}_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:blog/post",".html",".html","jawadateeq.com/blog/vipassana.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"jawadateeq.com/blog/vipassana.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740107533602,"modifiedTime":1740108227006,"sourceSize":12378,"sourcePath":"jawadateeq.com/Blog/vipassana.md","exportPath":"jawadateeq.com/blog/vipassana.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"jawadateeq.com/blog/year_in_review.html":{"title":"year_in_review","icon":"","description":":::\n<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Posts</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/stories/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stories</a>\n::::\n:::::\n::::::: {#container}\n:::::: container\n::: post-header:::::: {.post-content .clearfix}\nAnother year gone.It seemed that this year I emerged from a long, dark passage of the\nsoul. I had been \"imprisoned\" in this passage for a few years, at least\nsince I turned thirty three years ago. Of course, hindsight is 2020. I\nneeded that dark passage to understand better what path to take.Whilst in this dark passage, I felt incapable of bearing the ongoings in\nvarious dimensions of my life. Pandemic notwithstanding, the stressed\nstemmed from dimensions including dysfunctions within the family,\ncareer's constant upward and onward pressure, and a nagging feeling that\nI'm not living up to my truest potential.I didn't have good coping mechanisms either. I took the pressure from\nthe various dimensions of this life, and beat myself up constantly. I\nresorted to suboptimal coping mechanisms, leading to reduced impulse\ncontrol.Most of this year I remained shrouded in darkness. I am surprised at how\nI functioned, really. There was a constant stream of thought occupying\nthe limited capacity of my brain, leaving no room for problem-solving.Over the course of a few years this led to deteriorating health (I put\non 60lbs) and . I lost sight of who I really was. I started to lose\nconfidence that I could move moles, let alone mountains. I felt\nimpotent, unable able to effect anything or anyone.But later this year, something clicked and I decided I had had enough. I\nrealized that there were things I could take charge of, and others that\nI couldn't really control. This is a lesson emphasized in<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/posts/vipassana/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/posts/vipassana/\" target=\"_self\">Vipassana</a>: don't get attached\nto the contents of life, and don't run away from them either. Life is\nconstant flux; try to remain equanimous. Bruce Lee called this \"be like\nwater\".It was time to get to work. Rather than being reactive, it was time to\ntake control of how I was spending my time, and to do everything I could\nthat was within my circle of control. I decided to move forward in my<br>\nrelationship, starting by propopsing to my now fiancee. I joined <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/posts/physical_fitness_journey/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/posts/physical_fitness_journey/\" target=\"_self\">a\nCalisthenics\ngym</a> and started\nmy journey towards moving the way I've always dreamt of. I started\nworking on more \"spiritual\" matters, beginning with practices that\nremind me daily why I'm here, and to center me when the ups and downs of\nlife threaten to derail me. I also made some progress on where I want to\nhead towards in my career.Next year, I will take my focus on health to the next level, by also\nfocusing on how I eat. At the moment food has become one way to reward\nmyself, and I must learn how to balance this with \"food as fuel\". I plan\nto advance with calisthenics as well, by acheiving my goal of doing my\nfirst pull-up as well as my first muscle-up. I have other goals too, so\nI'm optimistic for 2024.Yes, there's a lot of pain out there in other parts of the world. And\nthe best thing I can do for the world is to not be a part of the\nproblem. I must become powerful and potent, so that when the time comes,\nI can apply myself and bring the world towards better outcomes.\nIdealistic, yes. Better this than wallowing in my self-pity.\n:::::: share\n:::\n::::::\n:::::::\n::::::::::::::: container\n::: site-title-wrapper<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#\" href=\"jawadateeq.com/blog/year_in_review.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"></a>{.button-square .button-jump-top .js-jump-top\naria-label=\"Back to Top\"}\n:::<br>© 2024 / Powered by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://gohugo.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_self\">Hugo</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ghostwriter theme</a> By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" target=\"_self\">JollyGoodThemes</a> /<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ported</a> to Hugo By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub\" target=\"_self\">jbub</a>\n::::","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq_.site-title}_0"},{"heading":"Year In Review: 2023 {#year-in-review-2023 .post-title}","level":1,"id":"Year_In_Review_2023_{#year-in-review-2023_.post-title}_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq-1 .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq-1_.site-title}_0"}],"links":[".html",".html","jawadateeq.com/blog/year_in_review.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"jawadateeq.com/blog/year_in_review.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740107457969,"modifiedTime":1740108097934,"sourceSize":3919,"sourcePath":"jawadateeq.com/Blog/year_in_review.md","exportPath":"jawadateeq.com/blog/year_in_review.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"jawadateeq.com/stories/cicadas.html":{"title":"cicadas","icon":"","description":"<a href=\".?query=tag:blog/stories\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#blog/stories\">#blog/stories</a>:::\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Posts</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/stories/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stories</a>\n::::\n:::::\n::::::: {#container}\n:::::: container\n::: post-header:::::: {.post-content .clearfix}<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada\" target=\"_self\">Cicadas</a> are insects that hatch\nand live underground for the majority of their lives, and emerge only to\nmate. They are as innocuous as they are loud. From high up the tree\nbarks, the males produce the sound by periodically flexing instruments\ncalled tymbals located in the abdomen. Shortly upon finding a mate and\nbreeding, they die.By the time I noticed there was something different about the sound of\nCicadas, I had already heard their call many times before. It wasn't\nuntil I stumbled into one of their choir earlier this summer, while\nidling in a Torontonian park in defiance of Covid, that it dawned on me\ntheir call resembled other noteworthy sounds, like the theme song to\nInterstellar, or the chanting of Tibetan monks. It started to fit the\nCicadian Song evoked an out-of-this-world feeling. The story that\nfollows is inspired by---and therefore dedicated to---that choir of\nCicadas.Like our music, their music developed in stages. Mihād didn't know it at\nthe time, but an ensemble of Cicadas was behind the thrumming. Wandering\nalone along a muddied country trail during recess one overcast morning,\nhe hadn't planned on hearing their song, especially here of all places,\nat the tail end of a silent retreat. \"It's the most thrilling thing and\nthe most terrifying thing,\" he would later extol in reverent tones to\nconfused companions. \"It's a mating call,\" confused companions would\nmutter in irreverent jest.By the time Mihād stumbled into The Song, the introduction was already\nwell under way. The Song drew in the listener, eased him in, and the\nSinger knew there was no other way. Had the hum not emanated from up\nabove, from that perforated canopy of sugar maple birch leaves yet to\nsuccumb to autumn, Mihād would've surely mistaken it for the distant\ndrone of a combine harvesting wheat from adjoining farmlands. Gently the\ntune withdrew him from mental minutiae into a foreign frequency.Now the leader of the band of Cicada, satisfied with such attentive\naudience, shifted into dynamic pre-chorus, and the gang joined on cue.\nTogether they amplified what the intro began, and steadily the tone\nascended---rising and rising, all the while gathering intensity. Up, up,\nup it went, not in the linear directness of bottom to up, but rather in\na spiralling transition reminiscent of swirling dervishes.What had begun as a soft serenade now erupted into full-blown crescendo.\nEach climb in decibel wrought positive havoc on Mihād's senses. By the\ntime he realized he had embarked a rollercoaster, the ride had already\ncrossed the summit of no return.So far from the commotion of commerce, the choir couldn't have hoped for\nbetter ambiance. The Cicadian chorus shook Mihād. He felt struck like a\ntuning fork. Up until a few moments ago, Mihād's eyes had delivered\nunwavering reports of mud-road, birch canopy and cloud cover. Now they\nwere dancing to the tune of Cicadian vibrato. Each resounding wave that\ncrashed into him extracted him further from his reverie and flung him\ninto him. His surroundings closed on him from all directions. Mihād\ncouldn't have lost his senses even if he wanted to.An overwhelming surge of energy announced that something ominous was\napproaching, like the rising dust around Carthage must have announced\nthe marching Romans. This emphatic Cicadian rhythm falling from the\ntrees may as well be falling from the heavens. Mihād sought closeness to\nthe earth, and like a waterfall to the head the song brought him to the\nknees.He didn't realize it at the time, but the Cicadas' Song did not flow in\ncontinuous timbre. Instead it weaved in and out of crescendo, ebbing and\nflowing to maintain the potency within its chorus, first administered by\nthis Cicada, then that, each one stepping up round-robin to bathe him\nwith musical waterfall.Don't fight. The peaks of Cicadian vibration beat every cell of\nMihād's existence into submission, and the punctuating crests offered\nmomentary respite. He wasn't victim to the unconsciousness of trance, or\nthe insensibility of stupor. On the contrary, Mihād was too conscious.\nTremendously aware.All thought drowned. The envoloping vacuum made available every flicker\nof leaf, every syllable of wind and every particle of dew. Panting, eyes\nagape and mouth ajar, is how Mihād received the flood of sensations.\nSeconds melted into hours. Here opened into there. Mihād could\nno longer tell soaring from sinking.He thought his head might explode. His heart was pounding in his ears.\nHis lungs were frantic for oxygen. The Cicadian Song---the rocket---was\nnow achieving lift-off, and, in spite of the wailings of an unwilling\npassenger, The pressure forced his insides outwards.Then---just as Mihād was about to disappear into everything, leaving no\ndistance between subject and object---the pressure resolved! His senses\ndissolved and a swooping darkness took him. Out of unknown depths, a\nreel began to unwind...All thoughts ever thought, all feelings ever felt, all relationships\nflitted by. There were the earliest images of amma and abba, soon\nreplaced by memories of dearest schoolteachers. Each flitting thread of\nfriendship, every flame of passion kindled and doused, every like and\ndislike... each zoomed by in an instant.The highest tower, of an island prison,\nA captive Arabian, parched and beaten.\nWith head bowed, with hands cuffed,\nAwaits fate, a blade awaiting.Early twilight in high English summer,\nA garden's brimming, butteflies aflutter.\nA Romeo kneels, a Juliet elopes,\nA few miles south, a village befuddled.The name is Tara, dark and slender she is,\nShrouded in translucent purple, perched atop a backless couch she is.\nReminiscent of a colorful life, overlooking marble flooring,\nOnto a midsummer afternoon, peering through teakwood windows she is.The boy from Sudan, ran away from the gunman,\nAway from the village, dusty and overrun.\nHe knows not plenty, he knows not riches,\nHidden in a cupboard, never mind the roaches.The Nordic king's torso is bare.\nHis mares must have water and so must his men.\nScampering between rock and grassy patches,\nThey must wrestle that which lurks in the darkest den.The pious courageous priestess went down a grey compound,\nTo save the Yazidi girl whom the plunderer did hound.\nAll the flames' torches and all the stones' sound,\nCould not drown out the evil that hitherto was abound.A diligent student, alone in a dull classroom.\nOut comes a fairy, and how the room brightens.\nShe flutters to him, whispers to him,\nShe enchants him, and how his eyes widen.And then there was no more. There the reel ended. Abstract as they seem,\nMihād understood everything. The waterfall of energy descending up on\nhim filled him up to the brim. His senses restored and he looked out\nonce again onto that muddied country trail. The trail was fenced on one\nside with birched bark. This time though, he saw with the keenness of a\nlittle child, unsullied by memory.Tears streamed down his cheeks, and those that caught onto the wires of\nhis unkempt beard glistened in the sun. Mihād was ready to surrender. He\nhad found what he wasn't looking for. With gratitude, he lowered his\nhead down on to the earth and gave back excess energy. When he rose, he\nno longer heard The Song of the Cicadas.\n:::::: share\n:::\n::::::\n:::::::\n::::::::::::::: container\n::: site-title-wrapper<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#\" href=\"jawadateeq.com/stories/cicadas.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\"></a>{.button-square .button-jump-top .js-jump-top\naria-label=\"Back to Top\"}\n:::<br>© 2024 / Powered by <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://gohugo.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://gohugo.io/\" target=\"_self\">Hugo</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/roryg/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ghostwriter theme</a> By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://jollygoodthemes.com\" target=\"_self\">JollyGoodThemes</a> /<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub/ghostwriter\" target=\"_self\">Ported</a> to Hugo By<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/jbub\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/jbub\" target=\"_self\">jbub</a>\n::::","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq_.site-title}_0"},{"heading":"The Song Of Cicadas {#the-song-of-cicadas .post-title}","level":1,"id":"The_Song_Of_Cicadas_{#the-song-of-cicadas_.post-title}_0"},{"heading":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://jawadateeq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jawad Ateeq</a> {#jawad-ateeq-1 .site-title}","level":1,"id":"[Jawad_Ateeq](https//jawadateeq.com/)_{#jawad-ateeq-1_.site-title}_0"}],"links":["?query=tag:blog/stories",".html",".html","jawadateeq.com/stories/cicadas.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"jawadateeq.com/stories/cicadas.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1740107614697,"modifiedTime":1740435744622,"sourceSize":8278,"sourcePath":"jawadateeq.com/Stories/cicadas.md","exportPath":"jawadateeq.com/stories/cicadas.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"jawadateeq.com/stories/the_pursuit_of_zelion.html":{"title":"the_pursuit_of_zelion","icon":"","description":"<a href=\".?query=tag:blog/stories\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#blog/stories\">#blog/stories</a>:::\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Posts</a>\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"/stories/\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Stories</a>\n::::\n:::::\n::::::: {#container}\n:::::: container\n::: post-header:::::: {.post-content .clearfix}\n\"... That's incredible! Just the scale of it is staggering.\" The\nemphasis in Harry Hartman's voice reverberated off the acoustic wall\npanels lining the auditorium. A cardioid microphone was perched on his\nmahogany desk at the center of the stage. It was presently transducing\nHartman's analog wonder into electrical signals, which sped along\nserpentine circuits that ran the length of The Medusa. An array of\nantennae located in the spaceship's quarterdekc modulated these signals\nand broadcasted a frequency to which most of the Solar System had tuned\ninto.The stage opened up into semi-circular stands rising majestically one\nafter the other in dim, undulating arcs until they dissolved into\ncomplete darkness. In addition to the five thousand heads in the stands\nnodding their agreement with Hartman, the broadcasting unit registered\nanother hundred fifty million virtual heads. However, the hologram-ready\nscreen towering behind Hartman---the HoloVisor---could only capture a\nfraction of them.At the center of the Holovisor, the prominent projection of an hourglass\nstood out amidst the sea of virtual heads. With every passing moment\nmore sand trickled out from the bulb above into the one below. A modest\npile had already gathered there. A countdown underneath the hourglass\nannounced precisely what measure of time remained: ninety cevs. A\nhundred cevs make one shirev, and a shirev is the time it takes for one\nType-I ship revolution to complete. One shirev is an eighth of the\nEarth's rotation.Ninety CevsThe polyester armchair that stood on Hartman's left was reserved for the\nshow's guests. Tonight's guest, and the center of everyone's attention,\nsat still, with both hands clasped in his lap. Warm rays descending from\nthe main stage light fell upon his delicate form, which seemed so\nfragile that light appeared to pass straight through him. His dark eyes\nremained unfocussed as they gazed out into a faceless audience.On paper he was Floyd Ryzen, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the\nUniversity of Encordia, First Author of The Solarian Encyclopedia and\nFounder of Zelion; to Solaris though, he was simply \"Professor\". A\nlifetime at lecture hall podiums had trained the professor to convey\ndetail in his deliveries; tonight, however, had to be different. With\nthe hourglass draining incessantly, every syllable had to carry weight.Hartman was first to stir. He put aside the letter he was holding and\nproduced another one from behind his desk. \"Professor Ryzen,\nfive-year-old Marissa from the Venutian Quarter writes, 'Dear Professor,\ndada says we wouldn't be live without you so thanks! Can you help me\nplease what is your rek-mun-dation'\" ---Hartman contained a grin as he\nattempted to remain true to text--- \"'for what I should be when I grow\nup?'\"For a few moments, the hourglass slipped from Solarian awareness as the\naudience cooed at the innocence in the letter. As Ryzen smiled, his\nwizened face broke into a hundred lines, and fifty years appeared\ndeducted from him. \"Dear Marissa,\" he began softly, \"you are very\nwelcome!\" Dotage had lent his baritone a hoarse quality, but as Ryzen\naddressed the child it took to a gentler timbre. \"As for what you should\nbe when you're all grown up... the answer is already written inside\nyou.\" Then the professor resumed his silent gaze. The audience waited\nfor more, but when none came, a soft applause broke out.\"The answer is already written inside you---that's a T-shirt right\nthere!\" cheered Hartman. Brown, winged glasses teetered dangerously\nclose to the edge of his nose. The cheer in his voice conveyed an\nindomitable spirit, one that wouldn't be subdued even by the knowledge\nthat he'd been second choice as host. He understood his bouncy brand\nwasn't congruent with iconic moments like these, so when the network\nphoned him in, it took him by surprise. The paycheck was nice, but\nHartman would've done it for the privilege alone.Eighty-Five CevsThe host drew another letter. \"Mihād Arkum from the Chelum Belt asks,\n'Dear Professor, I'm wondering, in your opinion, which event in\nPost-Modern history contributed most to shifting us away from the\nsocioeconomic systems of the late Modern Era?'\"Hartman lowered the letter down onto his desk. In the auditorium, slowly\nthe atmosphere morphed as the question sank in. The lightheartedness\nfrom the letter before gave way to a grim curiosity. These days, talk of\nsocioeconomic systems and the late Modern Era invariably conjured images\nof a darker time in human history. Every day, at dinner tables around\nSolaris, well-meaning elders recounted solemn tales of the Resource\nWars.The guest thought for a few moments. This wasn't the first time he'd\nbeen probed on the anthropological socioeconomics of yesteryear---in\nfact, he mused, this would likely be the last--- but, as was habit, he\nsought the answer anew.\"Well, uh, let's see Mihād, it's difficult to identify any single event.\nThe thing about anthropological processes is that, like most intricate\nprocesses, they often require a horde of chained factors to fall into\nplace before a more transcendent reality can emerge. Our journey from\nthe late Modern Era down to present day civilization is no different.\"\nRyzen consulted the confidence monitor relaying the hourglass from the\nedge of the stage. \"I'm afraid I can speak to you of only a handful of\nthose factors.\"Eighty Cevs\"By the year twenty-ninety-four, as humanity stood rebuilding in the\naftermath of the Resource Wars, the socioeconomic systems of that\ncivilization had already received a substantial makeover. Contemporary\npower structures had both the context and the wisdom to realize that\nlatent factors like compassion, and empathy, went largely overlooked as\nfar as socioeconomic modelling was concerned. Thus began an era of\nunprecedented exploration into such arcane topics as the structure of\nemotion, and the nature of consciousness.\"\"Some decades later, Anjali Gupta, an Indian social scientist, published\nthe first high-fidelity model of human consciousness. Her model\nunlocked, amongst other things, empirical research into the inner\nworkings of human reward systems, collaboration under duress, and\noptimal states of individual satisfaction. Gupta's model transformed\npsychology; instead of reconstructing maps of meaning through the\nambiguity of natural language, the model offered a generalized map that\ncould be fine-tuned through interaction with the subject. But perhaps\nthe grandest achievement of Gupta's model was in revealing what reams\nand reams of data had hitherto withheld: that consciousness tends to be\nasymptotically unstable.\"\"No matter how the model was tweaked, after a finite time interval, the\nmodelled consciousness would catastrophically self-destruct more than\nninety-nice percent of the time. An explanation for this pre-destined\nself-destruction remained at large for many years, and the problem\ntroubled one researcher in particular. Ralph Gutenberg, who happened to\nbe studying causal models of motivation at Berkeley, realized he could\nuse Gupta's model to augment the sparse datasets on motivational\ncause-effect patterns by playing out parametrized episodes of the\nsimulated consciousness. But it would take work; Gupta's model was the\nrecipe, but what Gutenberg really needed was an automaton that could\nrapidly execute the recipe millions of times, with the flexibility to\nplug in different ingredients.\"\"When Gutenberg's team finally built an automaton that could simulate\nconsciousness, he got to experimenting immediately. And what Gutenberg\nfound startled even himself: the consciousness implicitly creates a\nstructure, known later as the integrated ledger, to keep track of its\nnet activity debt. Using a patched version of Gupta's recipe, Gutenberg\nshowed that the simulation is asymptotically stable so long as its\nintegrated ledger is balanced.\"\"In his publications, Gutenberg explains that consciousness incurs an\nactivity loss if it revokes its awareness from experienced conditions.\nRevoking awareness reduces the consciousness' capacity to process\nreal-time signals, which must then fester in a backlog of unprocessed\nsignals, borrowing bandwidth from future 'processing'. Gutenberg called\nthis 'buffering' of old signals a 'loss', because with limited\nprocessing capacity the simulation had to rely on a lower-dimensional,\nmore inefficient form of decision-making, which led to even higher\nlosses. On the other hand, the simulation incurs an activity reward if\nit increases its awareness to experienced conditions. By controlling\nawareness, consciousness can maintain a neutral environment conducive to\nongoing evolution---that is, it achieves stability.\"\"Gutenberg's simulation gave us mathematical intuition that to walk\naround with an unbalanced ledger is self-destructive. This Integrated\nLedger Principle, as it came to be known, transformed our relationship\nwith ourselves. It transformed our judicial systems; the instigator\nwould eventually 'self- punish', and the victim was at peace from the\nknowledge of it. The Principle gave us an objective way to assess\nbalance, an acid test we still use when picking our leaders. For the\nfirst time in a long time, we built a society that optimizes for balance\nin integrated ledgers, rather than optimizing for the will of the masses\nlike earlier societies that lived by the law of large numbers.\"\"But even though Gutenberg's proof of the Integrated Ledger Principle\nwas revolutionary, it too suffered from a limitation. Gutenberg's\nsimulations occurred in a closed system---the simulations couldn't\ninteract with the real world---which limited their applicability to\nreal-life situations. That changed with Andrey Heidel, the zoologist\nstudying plasticity of awareness in Indonesian Orangutans.\"Seventy Cevs\"Heidel had invented the world's first myo-psychic electrode---or 'MPE',\nas he called them---to better study the relationship between an\nOrangutan's motor neuron signals and its field-of-attention. When Heidel\nheard of Gutenberg's work, he scrapped what he was doing, much to the\ndismay of his sponsors, and got to work on a different research\ninterest. You see, the MPE held the potential to feed sensory and\nactuator signals directly into the simulation, turning Gutenberg's\nclosed simulation into an open one. If Heidel were to succeed, his\nsimulation would be truly revolutionary. For example, such a simulation\nwould unlock the playing out of episodes concerning real-life events by\nusing the electrode to fine-tune the pre-trained simulated\nconsciousness.\"\"Heidel did succeed, and his simulation, which we still use today, made\nsome profound revelations. One of them was that a unit of consciousness\ncould be made to balance its ledger faster by shaping the\ncharacteristics of the myo-psychic signal fed into it. His work gave us\na deeper understanding of the relationship between psychological and\nphysiological makeups. Heidel gave us empirical proof that natural law\nis embedded within all conscious agents. His group went on to publish\nmany corollaries to Gutenberg's Principle, one of which even showed that\nthe mathematics of consciousness without built-in legality doesn't\nwork.\"\"And so, Mihād, you see, there are many layers to unpack in your\nquestion. Gupta's work laid the foundation for Gutenberg's Principle,\nwithout which Heidel wouldn't have invented an open simulation. Many\nsuch revolutionary milestones have passed us by on the road to\nmodern-day systems. Their contributions have given us an evolved form of\nscalable government, empirical insights into the nature of\nconsciousness, and, of course, most fundamentally, another dimension in\nour decision-making as we navigate the question of how best to live our\nlives.\"Sixty-Four CevsHartman read: \"'Professor Ryzen, what inspired you to create the\nSolarian Encyclopaedia?'\" \"Hmm, let's see... well, as you already know,\na sizeable portion of the literature on state-of-the-art energy\nharvestation techniques was lost to the Resource Wars. I think it's safe\nto say that without feasible methods of energy production, humanity\nwould've gone extinct many decades ago. Were it not for the support of\nmillions of inspired human beings, zillions of dollars in funding, and\nthe prowess of a dedicated scientific research community, the Resource\nWars would've set humanity back by a few centuries.\"\"And yet our energy demands will continue to rise. We've spent far too\nmuch effort scavenging for non-hydrocarbon-based energy methods to risk\nlosing it all over again. Starting over would be disastrous for our\nspace-faring civilization. This encyclopaedia\"---Ryzen gestured to the\nbook on Hartman's desk---\"is a culmination of the effort of a community\nof forward-thinking leaders, created with the express mission to set\nhumanity sailing back on course, and to keep it there. We've made\ninvaluable progress over the last century which must be transmitted to\nposterity. This encyclopaedia is our affirmation to our successors that\nwe played our part to foster a forward trend in the expansion of our\ncollective consciousness.\"Sixty Cevs\"'Professor, why does Zelion pursue the development of Type II\ncivilization methods? What's the best way to get there?'\"Ryzen sat up straighter. \"Well, to start with, getting to Type II, what\nwe call Project Earth Two Point O' at Zelion, is not vain\nambition---it's necessity.\" His tone carried the air of a man who had\nspent his entire life studying human civilizations. \"Energy has been a\ndecisive factor in determining a civilization's productive capacity for\nas far back as recorded history. A civilization capable of harvesting\nmore energy than another will win in an armed conflict every time---the\nResource Wars made that clear as day.\"\"If there is still any doubt that getting to Type II is a necessity,\nconsider this. First, collective consciousness must balance its\ncollective ledger, otherwise it is derailed onto a path of self-assured\ndestruction. Second, Heidel's simulations show that activity loss tends\nto rise with predisposition to existential danger. And third, when\nenergy supplies stall, existential danger surges. So, you see, it\nfollows that energy supply must move lockstep with demand. If energy\ndemand rises exponentially, so must its supply. And ever since the onset\nof the Information Age, demand has been rising exponentially.\"\"Opinions vary on how we can get there, but one thing remains clear: we\nmust move quickly. Whatever we do, we mustn't forget the lessons history\nrecorded on the road to Type I---lessons which beg us to safeguard\nagainst energy starvation as early as possible.\" Ryzen checked his\nconfidence monitor. \" This is an important point, so I'll hazard a\nbrisk walk down memory lane.\"Fifty-Five Cevs\"The beginning of the twentieth century saw the ground shake under the\nimpact of the first World Wars---the birthplace of the hydrocarbon\nmachine. This machine paved the path to industrialization, globalization\nand the resulting economies of scale. The hydrocarbon legacy of the\nWorld Wars laid the foundation for how the world would derive its energy\nfor another century. But this innovation came at a price; war optimizes\nfor speed and efficiency, leaving out such trifling factors as planetary\nwell-being or fair and equal outcomes. By the time the warning bells\ntolled, it was too late; the legacy hydrocarbon machine had taken firm\nroot. This machine ate the future so the world could go round in the\npresent.\"\"And so began in earnest a desperate attempt to move away from notorious\nhydrocarbons. Battery technology had matured significantly, but\nsomewhere along the battery production line hydrocarbons had to be\nburned to create the energy the batteries stored. The Photovoltaic cell,\na remarkable invention capable of creating electricity from sunlight,\ncost too much for the wattage it produced. Renewable biofuel like\nEthanol and Biodiesel burned cleaner than hydrocarbons, but troublesome\nmonoculture farming thwarted efforts to scale up to global proportions.\nHydrogen fuel cell technology, responsible for the bulk of potable water\naboard this very ship, was still expensive then compared with cheap\nfossil-based fuel. So, where then could the world pin its hopes?\"\"Oddly enough, nuclear fission---the principle underpinning nuclear\nweapons of mass destruction--- found widespread use in the first half of\nthe twenty-first century. Then again, perhaps this is not so surprising,\nseeing as departments of defence around the globe were eager to fund\nthis area of research. What's curious though, is that nuclear fission\nreactors prevailed despite infamous disasters that remain forever etched\nin our collective mind. The fission reaction is a potentially 'run away'\nchain reaction, leaving a mushroom cloud in its wake and radioactive\nsites that remain hazardous for thousands of Earth years. So, despite\nits temporary adoption, the fission reactor's days were numbered.\"\"Which brings us to nuclear fusion. Fusion reactions create temperatures\nso hot they create a plasma, which then burns the surrounding fuel. The\ntriple product of plasma ion density, plasma temperature and the\nconfinement time govern energy output of fusion reactions. The result is\nclean energy, chain reactions that don't run away and dissipate in\nshorter half-lives, and above all, energy output to match that of the\nstars.\"\"Building fusion reactors though, involved advanced physics rarely\npracticed elsewhere. The engineering had to be spot on. It's no surprise\nthat fusion reactors cost billions of dollars, and it would still be a\nfew decades before the energy output per dollar made sense. At best,\nhumanity could fund a few scattered reactors, which may actually have\nfuelled the case for a resource war. No; it would still take another\norder of magnitude in cost reduction before humanity could take refuge\nin fusion.\"\"And all this time, as humanity foraged for sustainably scalable energy,\nhydrocarbons---an exhaustible resource---kept on depleting. Fear arose.\nThe exhaustion of the hydrocarbon would halt all the machinery it drove,\nand with it, life as people knew it. From transportation and data\ncenters to more fundamental requirements like feeding populations and\nkeeping them warm, all systems would fail.\"\"So, by the time the Resource Wars broke out, the consequences of\nburning hydrocarbons had already been foreseen decades ago, but no one\nknew how to mitigate them. Yes, new research had set in motion a shift\naway from hydrocarbon-based economies, but supply couldn't keep up with\ndemand. Consumption, even amongst ordinary civilians, was so high that\nleaders feared mutiny should they interfere with the layman's lofty\nlifestyle.\"\"Of course, corporate malfeasance and political ambition delayed\nprogress too. Large corporations---the imperialists of the Modern Era---\nfacilitated hydrocarbon-hungry lifestyles to create more stable income\nstreams; they called it a 'recurring revenue model'. Sponsorship that\ncould've funded responsible energy sequestration was used instead to\ndrive consumerism to soaring heights. A vicious cycle set in:\nhydrocarbons fueled supply chains, which encouraged consumerism, which\nintensified demand and further stoked hydrocarbon-based supply chains.\"\"Gradually, humans exiled temperance. Unbeknownst, minimalism was\nbanished. Our collective planet-awareness plummeted. In the wake of\nglobalization and its economies of scale, producers learned to keep\nconsumers far removed from their deviant means of production. Pavlovian\nconsumers fell into the routine of turning a blind eye.\"\"It began in under-resourced societies first; loved ones fell to hunger\nand thirst, and of cold in the winter months. The sickly that remained\nfound little treatment. As the Doomsday Clock struck 2 seconds to\nmidnight, nations with any last remaining morsels of coal or freshwater\nriver were met with a sobering thought: they were fated to spend the\nlast of their frantic days fending off the rest of the famished world.\"Thirty-Nine Cevs\"All this time, humanity was still sitting at point eight on the\nKardashev scale. Every technique in the renewable energy handbook was\neither exorbitantly expensive, blatantly unfeasible or impertinently\ninefficient. It seemed only a miracle could get us to Type I, and yet\nthat's exactly what was required, not only to save a dying planet, but\nto save a civilization imploding under the weight of its own demands.\"\"And a miracle did happen. Hope came, at the eleventh hour, in the\ntwenty-sixties. Physicists Sue Lee Kwon and Priyanka Ajithkumar, in an\nunderground war bunker in South Korea, developed an artificially\nintelligent model that narrowed down the search space for possible\ntemperature-resistant molecular sequences. By conducting an ablative\nstudy with the remaining sequences, Kwon and Ajithkumar invented a new\nmaterial, Cermathil, alloys of which we still use in the walls of our\nspaceships. Single-handedly, Cermathil reduced implementation costs for\nfusion reactors and increased the triple product. The rest, as they say,\nis history.\"\"A century's worth of innovation followed, leaving us wielding more\nenergy than a Type I civilization could dream of. Humanity was able to\nrescue itself from itself. Out of the ashes of the Resource Wars we\nfashioned for ourselves a new, clean home. Today we have spaceships\ndedicated to terraforming future habitats. We've invested in\nspace-faring solar power centers that can transduce unsullied sunlight\ninto everything from food and clothing to electricity and shelter. We\ncan fuse atoms in the endless vacuum of space, at a fraction of the cost\nand effort. And of course, we've learned to live within our means. The\ncapacity to find satisfaction in the tiniest of morsels of greenbread is\nthe true prize of modern life.\"\"But space life is as yet nascent. To scale to interstellar proportions\nwill take yet more energy. For one, we would certainly need advancements\nin power transmission technology. We know how to store energy well, but\nwe don't know how to transmit it over the long, incalculable distances\nspanning our galaxy without leaking most of it. Broadly speaking, we\nhave two ways to get to Type II: either we harvest energy at the Sun\n(where it is strongest and least attenuated) and beam it back to\nSolarian consumers, or we learn to generate megawatts on the go. Solving\nefficient energy transfer will set the stage for interstellar expansion,\nending humanity's reliance on a singular Sun. But I hope we can see that\ngetting there, and quickly, is a necessity which we must start acting on\nnow.\"Twenty-Two Cevs\"'Professor, do you believe in God?'\"\"It doesn't matter what I believe.\" The abruptness in the professor's\nreply took the audience by surprise.Ryzen must have sensed this, for he explained: \"Whatever that term 'God'\npoints to is non- falsifiable. Science investigates what our senses and\nthe extensions thereof can perceive. Our senses report through\nquantifiable signals, but the quantifiable needs a physical medium for\nexpression. We can't say much about what lies at the end of the term\nGod, because what we can say is limited to what our consciousness can\nreceive through the senses. As soon as one mentions the term God, what\nfollows is a commentary about an experience devoid of physical\nsubstance. So, while the experience of any one unit of consciousness is\ninvaluable to itself, it's nothing short of fable to another unit.\"\"The concept of 'God' was invented by consciousness that, in a variety\nof ways, arrived upon a state of existence so utterly shocking, that it\ntransformed the very fibre of its existence. Where previously life was a\ndull thrum, now it became magical. Every action used to require thought\nand consideration; now one rested in the faith that life would converge\nto a global optimum. The state of anxiety and fear that previously ruled\nconsciousness was itself overruled by unconditional love.\"\"This is the state when the ledger from Gutenberg's Principal balances,\na point when consciousness achieves asymptotic stability. And it so\nhappens that once there, consciousness cannot help but endow others with\nasymptotic stability too. But how to share this inwardly originating\nexperience intrinsic to one unit of consciousness with other units, when\nthe only available medium is the language of the physical senses? So,\nrepetitive practices were invented; each stable consciousness invented a\nset of practices---rituals---perhaps supplemented with a guidebook. What\nthey left behind was code for the consciousness which, when executed,\ncreated conditions that incited the consciousness to restore balance in\nits integrated ledger.\"\"Do I believe in 'God'? I say it doesn't affect you in the least. In\nfact, I propose a different set of questions: What makes life magical\nfor you? And have you ever had the experience of unspeakable communion\nwith another unit of consciousness? If not, I suggest you roll the dice\nand take a gamble. Try new things till your answer changes to a\nresounding 'yes!'. And once you find it, hold on tightly to the thread\nthat got you there. Do it over and over until you are roiling in the\nunconditional union which is characteristic of that state. This is just\none example of code that can bring balance.\"Ten CevsAs the last remaining specks of sand trickled away, the mood in the\nauditorium grew even more sombre. Solarians had known for many years\nthat the proverbial sun would set on the crucible out of which humanity\nemerged, but as that time drew nigh, the reality of the moment became\ndisconcertingly inescapable. An occasional sob, an odd sniffle, rose\nfrom the stands. Even Hartman's trained voice faltered.\"Thank you, Professor Ryzen. Is there... is there anything you'd like to\nsay? As we near the end of our countdown?\"Ryzen consulted the confidence monitor one last time. Then, with a long\nexhale, he spoke: \"Yes, thank you, Harry. I want to say that this may be\nthe end for our first home, but I'm grateful that it's not the end for\nhumanity. Out of apes we fashioned a spacefaring nation that has\ntranscended nuclear war, disease, and now the death of our planet.\nTogether, we learned to look past the differences in our beliefs and our\nappearances, to instead revel in our diversity, and to see through to\nwhat's actually important, what lies at the core---our collective\nconsciousness.\"\"But this is no time to rest. We may have a new home amongst the stars,\nbut this home is untethered. So, we must create tethers. It took the\ncontributions of millions of people throughout the ages to get here, all\nto protect the future promise of a stable, collective consciousness. Let\nme repeat and say, this is not the time to rest.\"Three Cevs\"To Solarian leaders I hand the reins of Zelion, where you will find\ntools to catalyze the onset of a Type II civilization. In the custody of\nSolarian civilians, I leave the encyclopaedia, as a reminder of the\nendless potency of human perseverance. And for our children, I leave the\nimage of the pale blue dot. I hope that all consciousness will\nstabilize.\"Ryzen ended with a smile, just as he had begun.Zero CevsAbout two hundred thousand miles away, the asteroid christened Shiva\ndestroyed the world called Earth, and with that ended the hologrammatic\ntransmission of Floyd Ryzen, Professor of Anthropology at the University\nof Encordia, and Founder of Zelion, whom Solarians knew simply as\n\"Professor\".\n:::::: share\n:::\n::::::\n:::::::\n::::::::::::::: container\n::: site-title-wrapper<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"#\"
