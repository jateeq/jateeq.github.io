"... That's <em>incredible</em>! Just the scale of it is <em>staggering</em>." The<br>
emphasis in Harry Hartman's voice reverberated off the acoustic wall<br>
panels lining the auditorium. A cardioid microphone was perched on his<br>
mahogany desk at the center of the stage. It was presently transducing<br>
Hartman's analog wonder into electrical signals, which sped along<br>
serpentine circuits that ran the length of The Medusa. An array of<br>
antennae located in the spaceship's quarterdekc modulated these signals<br>
and broadcasted a frequency to which most of the Solar System had tuned<br>
into.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The stage opened up into semi-circular stands rising majestically one<br>
after the other in dim, undulating arcs until they dissolved into<br>
complete darkness. In addition to the five thousand heads in the stands<br>
nodding their agreement with Hartman, the broadcasting unit registered<br>
another hundred fifty million virtual heads. However, the hologram-ready<br>
screen towering behind Hartman---the HoloVisor---could only capture a<br>
fraction of them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">At the center of the Holovisor, the prominent projection of an hourglass<br>
stood out amidst the sea of virtual heads. With every passing moment<br>
more sand trickled out from the bulb above into the one below. A modest<br>
pile had already gathered there. A countdown underneath the hourglass<br>
announced precisely what measure of time remained: ninety cevs. A<br>
hundred cevs make one shirev, and a shirev is the time it takes for one<br>
Type-I ship revolution to complete. One shirev is an eighth of the<br>
Earth's rotation.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Ninety Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The polyester armchair that stood on Hartman's left was reserved for the<br>
show's guests. Tonight's guest, and the center of everyone's attention,<br>
sat still, with both hands clasped in his lap. Warm rays descending from<br>
the main stage light fell upon his delicate form, which seemed so<br>
fragile that light appeared to pass straight through him. His dark eyes<br>
remained unfocussed as they gazed out into a faceless audience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">On paper he was Floyd Ryzen, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the<br>
University of Encordia, First Author of The Solarian Encyclopedia and<br>
Founder of Zelion; to Solaris though, he was simply "Professor". A<br>
lifetime at lecture hall podiums had trained the professor to convey<br>
detail in his deliveries; tonight, however, had to be different. With<br>
the hourglass draining incessantly, every syllable had to carry weight.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hartman was first to stir. He put aside the letter he was holding and<br>
produced another one from behind his desk. "Professor Ryzen,<br>
five-year-old Marissa from the Venutian Quarter writes, 'Dear Professor,<br>
dada says we wouldn't be live without you so thanks! Can you help me<br>
please what is your rek-mun-dation'" ---Hartman contained a grin as he<br>
attempted to remain true to text--- "'for what I should be when I grow<br>
up?'"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For a few moments, the hourglass slipped from Solarian awareness as the<br>
audience cooed at the innocence in the letter. As Ryzen smiled, his<br>
wizened face broke into a hundred lines, and fifty years appeared<br>
deducted from him. "Dear Marissa," he began softly, "you are very<br>
welcome!" Dotage had lent his baritone a hoarse quality, but as Ryzen<br>
addressed the child it took to a gentler timbre. "As for what you should<br>
be when you're all grown up... the answer is already written inside<br>
you." Then the professor resumed his silent gaze. The audience waited<br>
for more, but when none came, a soft applause broke out.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"The answer is already written inside you---that's a T-shirt right<br>
there!" cheered Hartman. Brown, winged glasses teetered dangerously<br>
close to the edge of his nose. The cheer in his voice conveyed an<br>
indomitable spirit, one that wouldn't be subdued even by the knowledge<br>
that he'd been second choice as host. He understood his bouncy brand<br>
wasn't congruent with iconic moments like these, so when the network<br>
phoned him in, it took him by surprise. The paycheck was nice, but<br>
Hartman would've done it for the privilege alone.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Eighty-Five Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The host drew another letter. "Mihād Arkum from the Chelum Belt asks,<br>
'Dear Professor, I'm wondering, in your opinion, which event in<br>
Post-Modern history contributed most to shifting us away from the<br>
socioeconomic systems of the late Modern Era?'"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hartman lowered the letter down onto his desk. In the auditorium, slowly<br>
the atmosphere morphed as the question sank in. The lightheartedness<br>
from the letter before gave way to a grim curiosity. These days, talk of<br>
socioeconomic systems and the late Modern Era invariably conjured images<br>
of a darker time in human history. Every day, at dinner tables around<br>
Solaris, well-meaning elders recounted solemn tales of the Resource<br>
Wars.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The guest thought for a few moments. This wasn't the first time he'd<br>
been probed on the anthropological socioeconomics of yesteryear---in<br>
fact, he mused, this would likely be the last--- but, as was habit, he<br>
sought the answer anew.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Well, uh, let's see Mihād, it's difficult to identify any single event.<br>
The thing about anthropological processes is that, like most intricate<br>
processes, they often require a horde of chained factors to fall into<br>
place before a more transcendent reality can emerge. Our journey from<br>
the late Modern Era down to present day civilization is no different."<br>
Ryzen consulted the confidence monitor relaying the hourglass from the<br>
edge of the stage. "I'm afraid I can speak to you of only a handful of<br>
those factors."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Eighty Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"By the year twenty-ninety-four, as humanity stood rebuilding in the<br>
aftermath of the Resource Wars, the socioeconomic systems of that<br>
civilization had already received a substantial makeover. Contemporary<br>
power structures had both the context and the wisdom to realize that<br>
latent factors like compassion, and empathy, went largely overlooked as<br>
far as socioeconomic modelling was concerned. Thus began an era of<br>
unprecedented exploration into such arcane topics as the structure of<br>
emotion, and the nature of consciousness."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Some decades later, Anjali Gupta, an Indian social scientist, published<br>
the first high-fidelity model of human consciousness. Her model<br>
unlocked, amongst other things, empirical research into the inner<br>
workings of human reward systems, collaboration under duress, and<br>
optimal states of individual satisfaction. Gupta's model transformed<br>
psychology; instead of reconstructing maps of meaning through the<br>
ambiguity of natural language, the model offered a generalized map that<br>
could be fine-tuned through interaction with the subject. But perhaps<br>
the grandest achievement of Gupta's model was in revealing what reams<br>
and reams of data had hitherto withheld: that consciousness tends to be<br>
asymptotically unstable."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"No matter how the model was tweaked, after a finite time interval, the<br>
modelled consciousness would catastrophically self-destruct more than<br>
ninety-nice percent of the time. An explanation for this pre-destined<br>
self-destruction remained at large for many years, and the problem<br>
troubled one researcher in particular. Ralph Gutenberg, who happened to<br>
be studying causal models of motivation at Berkeley, realized he could<br>
use Gupta's model to augment the sparse datasets on motivational<br>
cause-effect patterns by playing out parametrized episodes of the<br>
simulated consciousness. But it would take work; Gupta's model was the<br>
recipe, but what Gutenberg really needed was an automaton that could<br>
rapidly execute the recipe millions of times, with the flexibility to<br>
plug in different ingredients."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"When Gutenberg's team finally built an automaton that could simulate<br>
consciousness, he got to experimenting immediately. And what Gutenberg<br>
found startled even himself: the consciousness implicitly creates a<br>
structure, known later as the integrated ledger, to keep track of its<br>
net activity debt. Using a patched version of Gupta's recipe, Gutenberg<br>
showed that the simulation is asymptotically stable so long as its<br>
integrated ledger is balanced."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"In his publications, Gutenberg explains that consciousness incurs an<br>
activity loss if it revokes its awareness from experienced conditions.<br>
Revoking awareness reduces the consciousness' capacity to process<br>
real-time signals, which must then fester in a backlog of unprocessed<br>
signals, borrowing bandwidth from future 'processing'. Gutenberg called<br>
this 'buffering' of old signals a 'loss', because with limited<br>
processing capacity the simulation had to rely on a lower-dimensional,<br>
more inefficient form of decision-making, which led to even higher<br>
losses. On the other hand, the simulation incurs an activity reward if<br>
it increases its awareness to experienced conditions. By controlling<br>
awareness, consciousness can maintain a neutral environment conducive to<br>
ongoing evolution---that is, it achieves stability."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Gutenberg's simulation gave us mathematical intuition that to walk<br>
around with an unbalanced ledger is self-destructive. This Integrated<br>
Ledger Principle, as it came to be known, transformed our relationship<br>
with ourselves. It transformed our judicial systems; the instigator<br>
would eventually 'self- punish', and the victim was at peace from the<br>
knowledge of it. The Principle gave us an objective way to assess<br>
balance, an acid test we still use when picking our leaders. For the<br>
first time in a long time, we built a society that optimizes for balance<br>
in integrated ledgers, rather than optimizing for the will of the masses<br>
like earlier societies that lived by the law of large numbers."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"But even though Gutenberg's proof of the Integrated Ledger Principle<br>
was revolutionary, it too suffered from a limitation. Gutenberg's<br>
simulations occurred in a closed system---the simulations couldn't<br>
interact with the real world---which limited their applicability to<br>
real-life situations. That changed with Andrey Heidel, the zoologist<br>
studying plasticity of awareness in Indonesian Orangutans."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Seventy Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Heidel had invented the world's first myo-psychic electrode---or 'MPE',<br>
as he called them---to better study the relationship between an<br>
Orangutan's motor neuron signals and its field-of-attention. When Heidel<br>
heard of Gutenberg's work, he scrapped what he was doing, much to the<br>
dismay of his sponsors, and got to work on a different research<br>
interest. You see, the MPE held the potential to feed sensory and<br>
actuator signals directly into the simulation, turning Gutenberg's<br>
closed simulation into an open one. If Heidel were to succeed, his<br>
simulation would be truly revolutionary. For example, such a simulation<br>
would unlock the playing out of episodes concerning real-life events by<br>
using the electrode to fine-tune the pre-trained simulated<br>
consciousness."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Heidel did succeed, and his simulation, which we still use today, made<br>
some profound revelations. One of them was that a unit of consciousness<br>
could be made to balance its ledger faster by shaping the<br>
characteristics of the myo-psychic signal fed into it. His work gave us<br>
a deeper understanding of the relationship between psychological and<br>
physiological makeups. Heidel gave us empirical proof that natural law<br>
is embedded within all conscious agents. His group went on to publish<br>
many corollaries to Gutenberg's Principle, one of which even showed that<br>
the mathematics of consciousness without built-in legality doesn't<br>
work."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"And so, Mihād, you see, there are many layers to unpack in your<br>
question. Gupta's work laid the foundation for Gutenberg's Principle,<br>
without which Heidel wouldn't have invented an open simulation. Many<br>
such revolutionary milestones have passed us by on the road to<br>
modern-day systems. Their contributions have given us an evolved form of<br>
scalable government, empirical insights into the nature of<br>
consciousness, and, of course, most fundamentally, another dimension in<br>
our decision-making as we navigate the question of how best to live our<br>
lives."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Sixty-Four Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hartman read: "'Professor Ryzen, what inspired you to create the<br>
Solarian Encyclopaedia?'" "Hmm, let's see... well, as you already know,<br>
a sizeable portion of the literature on state-of-the-art energy<br>
harvestation techniques was lost to the Resource Wars. I think it's safe<br>
to say that without feasible methods of energy production, humanity<br>
would've gone extinct many decades ago. Were it not for the support of<br>
millions of inspired human beings, zillions of dollars in funding, and<br>
the prowess of a dedicated scientific research community, the Resource<br>
Wars would've set humanity back by a few centuries."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"And yet our energy demands will continue to rise. We've spent far too<br>
much effort scavenging for non-hydrocarbon-based energy methods to risk<br>
losing it all over again. Starting over would be disastrous for our<br>
space-faring civilization. This encyclopaedia"---Ryzen gestured to the<br>
book on Hartman's desk---"is a culmination of the effort of a community<br>
of forward-thinking leaders, created with the express mission to set<br>
humanity sailing back on course, and to keep it there. We've made<br>
invaluable progress over the last century which must be transmitted to<br>
posterity. This encyclopaedia is our affirmation to our successors that<br>
we played our part to foster a forward trend in the expansion of our<br>
collective consciousness."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Sixty Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"'Professor, why does Zelion pursue the development of Type II<br>
civilization methods? What's the best way to get there?'"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ryzen sat up straighter. "Well, to start with, getting to Type II, what<br>
we call Project Earth Two Point O' at Zelion, is not vain<br>
ambition---it's necessity." His tone carried the air of a man who had<br>
spent his entire life studying human civilizations. "Energy has been a<br>
decisive factor in determining a civilization's productive capacity for<br>
as far back as recorded history. A civilization capable of harvesting<br>
more energy than another will win in an armed conflict every time---the<br>
Resource Wars made that clear as day."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"If there is still any doubt that getting to Type II is a necessity,<br>
consider this. First, collective consciousness must balance its<br>
collective ledger, otherwise it is derailed onto a path of self-assured<br>
destruction. Second, Heidel's simulations show that activity loss tends<br>
to rise with predisposition to existential danger. And third, when<br>
energy supplies stall, existential danger surges. So, you see, it<br>
follows that energy supply must move lockstep with demand. If energy<br>
demand rises exponentially, so must its supply. And ever since the onset<br>
of the Information Age, demand has been rising exponentially."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Opinions vary on how we can get there, but one thing remains clear: we<br>
must move quickly. Whatever we do, we mustn't forget the lessons history<br>
recorded on the road to Type I---lessons which beg us to safeguard<br>
against energy starvation as early as possible." Ryzen checked his<br>
confidence monitor. " This is an important point, so I'll hazard a<br>
brisk walk down memory lane."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Fifty-Five Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"The beginning of the twentieth century saw the ground shake under the<br>
impact of the first World Wars---the birthplace of the hydrocarbon<br>
machine. This machine paved the path to industrialization, globalization<br>
and the resulting economies of scale. The hydrocarbon legacy of the<br>
World Wars laid the foundation for how the world would derive its energy<br>
for another century. But this innovation came at a price; war optimizes<br>
for speed and efficiency, leaving out such trifling factors as planetary<br>
well-being or fair and equal outcomes. By the time the warning bells<br>
tolled, it was too late; the legacy hydrocarbon machine had taken firm<br>
root. This machine ate the future so the world could go round in the<br>
present."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"And so began in earnest a desperate attempt to move away from notorious<br>
hydrocarbons. Battery technology had matured significantly, but<br>
somewhere along the battery production line hydrocarbons had to be<br>
burned to create the energy the batteries stored. The Photovoltaic cell,<br>
a remarkable invention capable of creating electricity from sunlight,<br>
cost too much for the wattage it produced. Renewable biofuel like<br>
Ethanol and Biodiesel burned cleaner than hydrocarbons, but troublesome<br>
monoculture farming thwarted efforts to scale up to global proportions.<br>
Hydrogen fuel cell technology, responsible for the bulk of potable water<br>
aboard this very ship, was still expensive then compared with cheap<br>
fossil-based fuel. So, where then could the world pin its hopes?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Oddly enough, nuclear fission---the principle underpinning nuclear<br>
weapons of mass destruction--- found widespread use in the first half of<br>
the twenty-first century. Then again, perhaps this is not so surprising,<br>
seeing as departments of defence around the globe were eager to fund<br>
this area of research. What's curious though, is that nuclear fission<br>
reactors prevailed despite infamous disasters that remain forever etched<br>
in our collective mind. The fission reaction is a potentially 'run away'<br>
chain reaction, leaving a mushroom cloud in its wake and radioactive<br>
sites that remain hazardous for thousands of Earth years. So, despite<br>
its temporary adoption, the fission reactor's days were numbered."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Which brings us to nuclear fusion. Fusion reactions create temperatures<br>
so hot they create a plasma, which then burns the surrounding fuel. The<br>
triple product of plasma ion density, plasma temperature and the<br>
confinement time govern energy output of fusion reactions. The result is<br>
clean energy, chain reactions that don't run away and dissipate in<br>
shorter half-lives, and above all, energy output to match that of the<br>
stars."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Building fusion reactors though, involved advanced physics rarely<br>
practiced elsewhere. The engineering had to be spot on. It's no surprise<br>
that fusion reactors cost billions of dollars, and it would still be a<br>
few decades before the energy output per dollar made sense. At best,<br>
humanity could fund a few scattered reactors, which may actually have<br>
fuelled the case for a resource war. No; it would still take another<br>
order of magnitude in cost reduction before humanity could take refuge<br>
in fusion."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"And all this time, as humanity foraged for sustainably scalable energy,<br>
hydrocarbons---an exhaustible resource---kept on depleting. Fear arose.<br>
The exhaustion of the hydrocarbon would halt all the machinery it drove,<br>
and with it, life as people knew it. From transportation and data<br>
centers to more fundamental requirements like feeding populations and<br>
keeping them warm, all systems would fail."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"So, by the time the Resource Wars broke out, the consequences of<br>
burning hydrocarbons had already been foreseen decades ago, but no one<br>
knew how to mitigate them. Yes, new research had set in motion a shift<br>
away from hydrocarbon-based economies, but supply couldn't keep up with<br>
demand. Consumption, even amongst ordinary civilians, was so high that<br>
leaders feared mutiny should they interfere with the layman's lofty<br>
lifestyle."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Of course, corporate malfeasance and political ambition delayed<br>
progress too. Large corporations---the imperialists of the Modern Era---<br>
facilitated hydrocarbon-hungry lifestyles to create more stable income<br>
streams; they called it a 'recurring revenue model'. Sponsorship that<br>
could've funded responsible energy sequestration was used instead to<br>
drive consumerism to soaring heights. A vicious cycle set in:<br>
hydrocarbons fueled supply chains, which encouraged consumerism, which<br>
intensified demand and further stoked hydrocarbon-based supply chains."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Gradually, humans exiled temperance. Unbeknownst, minimalism was<br>
banished. Our collective planet-awareness plummeted. In the wake of<br>
globalization and its economies of scale, producers learned to keep<br>
consumers far removed from their deviant means of production. Pavlovian<br>
consumers fell into the routine of turning a blind eye."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It began in under-resourced societies first; loved ones fell to hunger<br>
and thirst, and of cold in the winter months. The sickly that remained<br>
found little treatment. As the Doomsday Clock struck 2 seconds to<br>
midnight, nations with any last remaining morsels of coal or freshwater<br>
river were met with a sobering thought: they were fated to spend the<br>
last of their frantic days fending off the rest of the famished world."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Thirty-Nine Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"All this time, humanity was still sitting at point eight on the<br>
Kardashev scale. Every technique in the renewable energy handbook was<br>
either exorbitantly expensive, blatantly unfeasible or impertinently<br>
inefficient. It seemed only a miracle could get us to Type I, and yet<br>
that's exactly what was required, not only to save a dying planet, but<br>
to save a civilization imploding under the weight of its own demands."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"And a miracle did happen. Hope came, at the eleventh hour, in the<br>
twenty-sixties. Physicists Sue Lee Kwon and Priyanka Ajithkumar, in an<br>
underground war bunker in South Korea, developed an artificially<br>
intelligent model that narrowed down the search space for possible<br>
temperature-resistant molecular sequences. By conducting an ablative<br>
study with the remaining sequences, Kwon and Ajithkumar invented a new<br>
material, Cermathil, alloys of which we still use in the walls of our<br>
spaceships. Single-handedly, Cermathil reduced implementation costs for<br>
fusion reactors and increased the triple product. The rest, as they say,<br>
is history."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"A century's worth of innovation followed, leaving us wielding more<br>
energy than a Type I civilization could dream of. Humanity was able to<br>
rescue itself from itself. Out of the ashes of the Resource Wars we<br>
fashioned for ourselves a new, clean home. Today we have spaceships<br>
dedicated to terraforming future habitats. We've invested in<br>
space-faring solar power centers that can transduce unsullied sunlight<br>
into everything from food and clothing to electricity and shelter. We<br>
can fuse atoms in the endless vacuum of space, at a fraction of the cost<br>
and effort. And of course, we've learned to live within our means. The<br>
capacity to find satisfaction in the tiniest of morsels of greenbread is<br>
the true prize of modern life."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"But space life is as yet nascent. To scale to interstellar proportions<br>
will take yet more energy. For one, we would certainly need advancements<br>
in power transmission technology. We know how to store energy well, but<br>
we don't know how to transmit it over the long, incalculable distances<br>
spanning our galaxy without leaking most of it. Broadly speaking, we<br>
have two ways to get to Type II: either we harvest energy at the Sun<br>
(where it is strongest and least attenuated) and beam it back to<br>
Solarian consumers, or we learn to generate megawatts on the go. Solving<br>
efficient energy transfer will set the stage for interstellar expansion,<br>
ending humanity's reliance on a singular Sun. But I hope we can see that<br>
getting there, and quickly, is a necessity which we must start acting on<br>
now."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Twenty-Two Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"'Professor, do you believe in God?'"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"It doesn't matter what I believe." The abruptness in the professor's<br>
reply took the audience by surprise.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ryzen must have sensed this, for he explained: "Whatever that term 'God'<br>
points to is non- falsifiable. Science investigates what our senses and<br>
the extensions thereof can perceive. Our senses report through<br>
quantifiable signals, but the quantifiable needs a physical medium for<br>
expression. We can't say much about what lies at the end of the term<br>
God, because what we can say is limited to what our consciousness can<br>
receive through the senses. As soon as one mentions the term God, what<br>
follows is a commentary about an experience devoid of physical<br>
substance. So, while the experience of any one unit of consciousness is<br>
invaluable to itself, it's nothing short of fable to another unit."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"The concept of 'God' was invented by consciousness that, in a variety<br>
of ways, arrived upon a state of existence so utterly shocking, that it<br>
transformed the very fibre of its existence. Where previously life was a<br>
dull thrum, now it became magical. Every action used to require thought<br>
and consideration; now one rested in the faith that life would converge<br>
to a global optimum. The state of anxiety and fear that previously ruled<br>
consciousness was itself overruled by unconditional love."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"This is the state when the ledger from Gutenberg's Principal balances,<br>
a point when consciousness achieves asymptotic stability. And it so<br>
happens that once there, consciousness cannot help but endow others with<br>
asymptotic stability too. But how to share this inwardly originating<br>
experience intrinsic to one unit of consciousness with other units, when<br>
the only available medium is the language of the physical senses? So,<br>
repetitive practices were invented; each stable consciousness invented a<br>
set of practices---rituals---perhaps supplemented with a guidebook. What<br>
they left behind was code for the consciousness which, when executed,<br>
created conditions that incited the consciousness to restore balance in<br>
its integrated ledger."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Do I believe in 'God'? I say it doesn't affect you in the least. In<br>
fact, I propose a different set of questions: What makes life magical<br>
for you? And have you ever had the experience of unspeakable communion<br>
with another unit of consciousness? If not, I suggest you roll the dice<br>
and take a gamble. Try new things till your answer changes to a<br>
resounding 'yes!'. And once you find it, hold on tightly to the thread<br>
that got you there. Do it over and over until you are roiling in the<br>
unconditional union which is characteristic of that state. This is just<br>
one example of code that can bring balance."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Ten Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As the last remaining specks of sand trickled away, the mood in the<br>
auditorium grew even more sombre. Solarians had known for many years<br>
that the proverbial sun would set on the crucible out of which humanity<br>
emerged, but as that time drew nigh, the reality of the moment became<br>
disconcertingly inescapable. An occasional sob, an odd sniffle, rose<br>
from the stands. Even Hartman's trained voice faltered.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"Thank you, Professor Ryzen. Is there... is there anything you'd like to<br>
say? As we near the end of our countdown?"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ryzen consulted the confidence monitor one last time. Then, with a long<br>
exhale, he spoke: "Yes, thank you, Harry. I want to say that this may be<br>
the end for our first home, but I'm grateful that it's not the end for<br>
humanity. Out of apes we fashioned a spacefaring nation that has<br>
transcended nuclear war, disease, and now the death of our planet.<br>
Together, we learned to look past the differences in our beliefs and our<br>
appearances, to instead revel in our diversity, and to see through to<br>
what's actually important, what lies at the core---our collective<br>
consciousness."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"But this is no time to rest. We may have a new home amongst the stars,<br>
but this home is untethered. So, we must create tethers. It took the<br>
contributions of millions of people throughout the ages to get here, all<br>
to protect the future promise of a stable, collective consciousness. Let<br>
me repeat and say, this is not the time to rest."</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Three Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">"To Solarian leaders I hand the reins of Zelion, where you will find<br>

endless potency of human perseverance. And for our children, I leave the<br>
image of the pale blue dot. I hope that all consciousness will<br>
stabilize."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ryzen ended with a smile, just as he had begun.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Zero Cevs</strong></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">About two hundred thousand miles away, the asteroid christened Shiva<br>
